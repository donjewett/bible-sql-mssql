EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003014,'But John tried to prevent him, saying, “I need to be baptized by yo?, and do yo? come to me?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003015,'But Jesus answered him, “Permit it for now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John permitted him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003016,'After being baptized, Jesus immediately went up from the water. And behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003017,'And behold, a voice from heaven said, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004001,'Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004002,'After fasting for forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004003,'Then the tempter came up to him and said, “If yo? are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004004,'But Jesus answered, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004005,'Then the devil took him to the holy city, set him on the pinnacle of the temple,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004006,'and said to him, “If yo? are the Son of God, throw yo?rself down, for it is written, ‘He will command his angels concerning yo?,’ and, ‘In their hands they will lift yo? up, so that yo? do not strike yo?r foot against a stone.’”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004007,'Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, ‘Yo? shall not put the Lord yo?r God to the test.’”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004008,'Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004009,'And he said to him, “All these things I will give yo?, if yo? will fall down and worship me.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004010,'Then Jesus said to him, “Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, ‘Yo? shall worship the Lord yo?r God, and him only shall yo? serve.’”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004011,'Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004012,'Now when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004013,'And leaving Nazareth, he went and dwelt at Capernaum by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004014,'so that what had been spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004015,'“Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004016,'the people sitting in darkness have seen a great light, and on those sitting in the region and shadow of death light has dawned.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004017,'From that time Jesus began to preach, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has drawn near.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004018,'As Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004019,'Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004021,'Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004022,'So they immediately left the boat and their father and followed him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004023,'Then Jesus went throughout all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004024,'So the news about him went out into all of Syria, and the people brought to him all who were sick with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics. And he healed them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004025,'And large crowds followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005001,'When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on the mountain. And when he sat down, his disciples came to him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005002,'Then he opened his mouth and taught them, saying,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005009,'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005010,'Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness'' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005011,'Blessed are you when others reproach you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005012,'Rejoice and be glad, for great is your reward in heaven; for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005013,'“You are the salt of the earth, but if salt loses its flavor, with what shall it be seasoned? It is no longer fit for anything but to be thrown out and trampled under people''s feet.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005014,'“You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005018,'For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter or stroke of a letter will by any means pass from the law until all is accomplished.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005019,'Therefore whoever does away with one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do likewise will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005020,'For I tell you, unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005021,'“You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘Yo? shall not murder,’ and, ‘Whoever murders will be subject to judgment.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005022,'But I say to you that everyone who is rashly angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Whoever says to his brother, ‘Yo? idiot,’ will be subject to the Sanhedrin. And whoever says, ‘Yo? fool,’ will be subject to the fires of hell.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005033,'Now the woman was frightened and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, so she came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005034,'Then Jesus said to her, “Daughter, yo?r faith has healed yo?. Go in peace, and be healed of yo?r affliction.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006001,'Then Jesus left that place and went to his hometown, and his disciples followed him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006002,'When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get these things? And what is this wisdom that has been given to him, that such miracles are done by his hands?'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006007,'He summoned the twelve and began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342022066,'When daybreak came, the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led Jesus up to their Sanhedrin and said,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345005016,'And the gift cannot be compared to the result of the one man''s sin; for the judgment that arose from one trespass brought condemnation, but the gift that arose from many trespasses brought justification.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007013,'Has that then which is good brought death to me? Certainly not! But sin, so that it would be shown to be sin, produced death in me through that which is good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008025,'But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patient endurance.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008026,'In the same way the Spirit also helps us in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008027,'And he who searches the hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008034,'Who is to condemn? Christ is the one who died, but more than that, he was raised and is at the right hand of God, interceding for us.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008039,'nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345009006,'It is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all Israelites truly belong to Israel,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345009008,'That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God; rather, the children of the promise are counted as descendants.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345009016,'So then, it does not depend on human will or effort, but on God''s mercy.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345009017,'For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “I have raised yo? up for the very purpose of showing my power in yo?, so that my name might be declared in all the earth.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345009025,'As he says in Hosea, “Those who were ‘not my people’ I will call ‘my people,’ and those who were ‘not beloved’ I will call ‘beloved.’'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345009031,'But Israel, although they pursued a law of righteousness, did not attain a law of righteousness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345009032,'Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as though it were by works of the law. They stumbled over the stone of stumbling,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345009033,'as it is written, “Behold, I am placing in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, yet no one who believes in him will be put to shame.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010002,'I can testify that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010003,'For they do not understand the righteousness of God, and by seeking to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted to God''s righteousness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010004,'For Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010005,'Moses writes about the righteousness that is by the law: “The person who does these things will live by them.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010006,'But the righteousness that is by faith speaks like this: “Do not say in yo?r heart, ‘Who will go up to heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down)'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010010,'For with the heart belief is exercised, resulting in righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made, resulting in salvation.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010011,'As the Scripture says, “No one who believes in him will be put to shame.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010012,'For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call upon him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010013,'For “everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010014,'How then will they call upon him in whom they have not believed? And how will they believe in him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without someone preaching?'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010016,'But not all the Israelites have obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010017,'So then, faith comes by hearing, and hearing comes through the word of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010018,'But I ask, have they not heard? On the contrary, “The message has gone out into all the earth, and the words to the ends of the world.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010019,'Again I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says, “I will provoke you to jealousy by that which is not a nation; by a nation that has no understanding I will provoke you to anger.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011002,'God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel, saying,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011016,'If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011017,'Now if some of the branches have been broken off, and yo?, a wild olive branch, have been grafted in among them and have become a fellow partaker of the root and richness of the olive tree,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011020,'Right! They were broken off because of unbelief, but yo? stand because of faith. So do not be arrogant, but be afraid.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011021,'For if God did not spare the natural branches, perhaps he will not spare yo? either.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011022,'Consider therefore the kindness and severity of God: to those who have fallen, severity; but to yo?, kindness, if yo? continue in his kindness; otherwise yo? too will be cut off.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345015003,'For even Christ did not please himself, but as it is written, “The reproaches of those who reproached yo? fell on me.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345015004,'For everything that was written in former times was written for our instruction, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures, we might have hope.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345015008,'Now I say that Christ Jesus has become a servant to the circumcised on behalf of the truth of God in order to confirm the promises that were made to the fathers,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345015009,'so that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, “Therefore I will confess yo? among the Gentiles; I will sing praise to yo?r name.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001011,'For it has been disclosed to me about you, my brothers, by those of Chloe''s household, that there are quarrels among you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001012,'What I mean is this: One of you says, “I follow Paul,” while another says, “I follow Apollos,” or, “I follow Cephas,” or, “I follow Christ.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001013,'Has Christ been divided? Was Paul crucified for you, or were you baptized into the name of Paul?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001014,'I give thanks to God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001015,'so that no one may say that I baptized into my own name.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001017,'For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, and not with cleverness of speech, so that the cross of Christ would not be deprived of its power.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001018,'For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001019,'For it is written, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the intelligence of the intelligent I will nullify.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001020,'Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made the wisdom of this world foolish?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001021,'For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of our proclamation to save those who believe.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001022,'For Jews ask for a sign and Greeks seek wisdom,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001023,'but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Greeks,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001024,'but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001025,'For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001026,'Consider your calling, brothers, that not many of you were wise according to the flesh, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001027,'But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001028,'God chose what is lowly and despised in the world, things that are regarded as nothing, to nullify the things that are regarded as something,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001029,'so that no flesh might boast before God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001030,'It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God, and in whom we have righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001031,'Therefore, as it is written, “Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002001,'When I came to you, brothers, I did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002002,'For I resolved to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002003,'I came to you in weakness and fear, and with much trembling.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002004,'And my word and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002005,'so that your faith would not be based on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002006,'Now we speak wisdom among the mature, but not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are being brought to nothing.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002007,'On the contrary, we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery, which God foreordained for our glory before time began.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002008,'None of the rulers of this age understood this wisdom, for if they had understood it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002009,'But, as it is written, “No eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no heart has imagined what God has prepared for those who love him.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002010,'Now God has revealed these things to us through his Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002011,'For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man''s spirit within him? In the same way, no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002012,'Now we did not receive the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we might understand what God has freely given us.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002013,'We speak about this, not with words taught by human wisdom but with words taught by the Holy Spirit, interpreting spiritual things to spiritual people.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002014,'The natural man does not accept what comes from the Spirit of God, because it is foolishness to him; he is not able to understand it because it is spiritually discerned.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002015,'But he who is spiritual makes judgments about all things, and yet he himself is not subject to any man''s judgment.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002016,'“For who has known the mind of the Lord so as to advise him?” But we have the mind of Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003001,'And so, brothers, I could not address you as spiritual men, but as men of the flesh, as infants in Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003002,'I fed you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it. Even now you are still not able,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003003,'for you are still of the flesh. For where there is jealousy, strife, and division among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving like mere men?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003004,'For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another says, “I follow Apollos,” are you not of the flesh?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003005,'Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but servants through whom you believed, as the Lord has assigned to each?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003006,'I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003007,'So then, neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but only God who gives the growth.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003008,'He who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003009,'For we are fellow workers of God; you are God''s field, God''s building.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003010,'According to the grace of God given to me, like a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it. But each person must be careful how he builds upon it.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003011,'For no one can lay a foundation other than the one that has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003012,'If anyone builds upon this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003013,'his work will become evident, for the Day will make it clear, because it is revealed by fire. And the fire will test each person''s work and reveal what sort of work it is.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003014,'If the work that anyone has built remains, he will receive a reward.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003015,'If anyone''s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; yet he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003016,'Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003017,'If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which is what you are.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003018,'Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, he should become foolish so that he may become truly wise.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003019,'For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. As it is written, “He catches the wise in their craftiness,”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003020,'and again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003021,'So then, let no one boast in men. For everything belongs to you,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003022,'whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world, or life or death, or things present or things to come—everything belongs to you,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003023,'and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004001,'People ought to regard us as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004002,'Now it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004003,'But for me it is a very small thing if I am judged by you, or by any human court. Indeed, I do not even judge myself.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004004,'For I am conscious of nothing against myself, yet I am not thereby acquitted; but he who judges me is the Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004005,'So then, do not judge anything before the appointed time. Wait until the Lord comes, who will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and reveal the intentions of the heart. At that time each person will receive his praise from God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004006,'Now, brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your sake, so that through us you may learn not to think beyond what is written, so that you may not be puffed up, with each one of you supporting one man against another.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004007,'For who regards yo? as superior? What do yo? have that yo? did not receive? And if yo? received it, why do yo? boast as though yo? did not receive it?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004008,'You are already full! You have already become rich! You have begun to reign without us! And how I wish that you really were reigning, so that we could reign with you!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004009,'For I think that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, as sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004010,'We are fools for the sake of Christ, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are esteemed, but we are dishonored.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004011,'To the present hour we hunger and thirst; we are poorly clothed and beaten down, with no home of our own.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004012,'We labor, working with our own hands. When we are reviled, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004013,'when we are slandered, we encourage. We have become like the refuse of the world, the scum of all things, even to this present time.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004014,'I am not writing this to shame you, but rather I am admonishing you as my beloved children.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004015,'For even if you had ten thousand guardians in Christ, you would not have many fathers. For in Christ Jesus I became a father to you through the gospel.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004016,'Therefore I urge you to be imitators of me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004017,'That is why I have sent you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways in Christ, just as I teach them everywhere in every church.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004021,'What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and a spirit of gentleness?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346005001,'It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, a kind of fornication that is not even named among the Gentiles, for a man has his father''s wife.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346005002,'And you are puffed up! You should have mourned instead and removed the man who did this from among you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346005003,'For though I am absent in body, I am present in spirit. And I have already judged the man who did this, just as though I were present.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346005004,'So when you are gathered together in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and I am with you in spirit, along with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346005006,'Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346005007,'Purge out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump of dough, since you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed for us.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012012,'For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members constitute one body even though they are many, so it is with Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012013,'For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free—and we have all been given to drink into one Spirit.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012014,'Even so the body does not consist of one member, but many.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012015,'If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,” is it for that reason not a part of the body?'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012019,'If they were all one member, where would the body be?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012020,'As it is, there are many members, yet one body.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012021,'The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of yo?,” nor in turn can the head say to the feet, “I have no need of you.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012022,'On the contrary, the members of the body that seem to be weaker are essential,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012023,'and the members of the body that we consider to be less honorable are clothed with more abundant honor. And our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012026,'If one member suffers, all the other members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the other members rejoice with it.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014001,'Pursue love, and earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but even more that you may prophesy.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014002,'For he who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he speaks mysteries in the Spirit.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014005,'Now I would like all of you to speak in tongues, but even more that you would prophesy. For greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be edified.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014006,'Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I speak to you with a revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014007,'It is the same way with lifeless instruments that produce sound, such as the flute or harp. If they do not produce distinct notes, how will anyone recognize what is being played?'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014009,'It is the same with you. If you do not produce intelligible speech with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014010,'There are undoubtedly many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them is without meaning.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014011,'If then I do not know the meaning of a particular language, I will be a foreigner to him who is speaking, and he who is speaking will be a foreigner to me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014012,'It is the same with you. Since you earnestly desire spiritual gifts, seek to abound in them for the edification of the church.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014013,'Therefore anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray for the ability to interpret what he says.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014014,'For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014015,'What then should I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also. I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing praise with my mind also.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014017,'For yo? may very well be giving thanks, but the other person is not edified.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014018,'I give thanks to my God speaking in tongues more than you all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014019,'Nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014020,'Brothers, do not be childish in your way of thinking. Rather, as to malice be infants, but in your way of thinking be mature.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014021,'In the law it is written, “With foreign tongues and with foreign lips I will speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014022,'So then, tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is a sign not for unbelievers but for believers.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014023,'So if the whole church comes together and everyone is speaking in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your minds?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014024,'But if an unbeliever or outsider comes in while everyone is prophesying, he will be convicted by all and called to account by all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014025,'The secrets of his heart will thus be revealed, and he will fall on his face and worship God, declaring that God is truly among you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014026,'What then should you do, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, a teaching, a tongue, a revelation, or an interpretation. Everything must be done for edification.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014027,'If any speak in a tongue, only two, or at the most three, should speak; they should each speak in turn, and someone must interpret.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014028,'But if there is no interpreter, they should keep quiet in the church and speak in tongues privately to God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014029,'Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should evaluate what they say.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014030,'But if something is revealed to another who is seated, the first speaker should be silent.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014031,'For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all may be encouraged.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014032,'Remember that the spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014033,'For God is not a God of disorder but of peace; this is true in all the churches of the saints.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014034,'Your women should be silent in the churches, for they have not been permitted to speak, but must be in submission, just as the law says.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014035,'If they want to learn anything, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for women to speak in church.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014036,'Or was it from you that the word of God came? Or are you the only ones it has reached?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014037,'If anyone thinks that he is a prophet or spiritual person, he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are commandments of the Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014038,'But if anyone ignores this, let him be ignorant.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014039,'So then, brothers, earnestly desire to prophesy and do not forbid speaking in tongues.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014040,'Let all things be done decently and in order.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015001,'Now I make known to you, brothers, the gospel that I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015003,'For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015004,'that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015005,'and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the twelve.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015007,'Next he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015008,'Last of all, as to one born at the wrong time, he appeared to me as well.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015010,'But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015012,'Now if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015013,'If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015014,'And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith is also in vain.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015015,'We are even found to be false witnesses about God, because we have testified against God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if indeed the dead are not raised.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015016,'For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015017,'And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015018,'Furthermore, those who have fallen asleep in Christ have also perished.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015019,'If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015020,'But as it is, Christ has been raised from the dead; he has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015021,'For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead has also come through a man.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015022,'For just as all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015023,'But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then, at his coming, those who belong to Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015024,'Then comes the end, when he hands the kingdom over to God the Father, after he has abolished all rule and all authority and power.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015025,'For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015026,'The last enemy to be abolished is death.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015027,'For God “has put everything in subjection under his feet.” Now when it says that “everything has been put in subjection,” it is evident that it does not include God himself, who put everything in subjection to Christ.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015030,'And why do we put ourselves in danger every hour?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015031,'I die daily! Yes, just as surely as I boast about you in Christ Jesus our Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015032,'If I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus with no more than human hopes, what did it benefit me? If the dead are not raised, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015036,'Fool! What yo? sow does not come to life unless it dies.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015037,'And what yo? sow is not the body that will be, but a bare kernel, perhaps of wheat or some other grain.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015038,'But God gives it a body just as he has determined, and he gives to each of the seeds its own body.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015039,'Not all flesh is the same flesh, but there is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for fish, and another for birds.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001020,'For in him every one of God''s promises is “Yes,” and in him we say “Amen” to the glory of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001021,'Now it is God who establishes us with you in Christ and who anointed us.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001022,'He has also sealed us and put his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001023,'I call upon God as a witness against me, that the reason I did not return to Corinth was to spare you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001024,'Not that we rule over your faith; rather, we work with you for your joy, because by faith you stand firm.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002001,'So I made up my mind that I would not come to you again in sorrow.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002002,'For if I make you sorrowful, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have made sorrowful?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002003,'That is why I wrote to you as I did, so that when I came I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence about you all that my joy would be yours.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002004,'For I wrote to you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you sorrow, but to let you know the abundant love I have for you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002005,'Now if anyone has caused sorrow, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure (not to put it too severely) to all of you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002006,'This punishment by the majority is enough for that person.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002007,'So you should forgive and comfort him instead, so that he will not be overwhelmed with excessive sorrow.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002008,'Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002009,'I wrote to you because I wanted to test your character and see if you would be obedient in everything.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002010,'Now if you forgive anyone of anything, I also forgive him. For if I have forgiven anyone of anything, I have done it for your sakes in the presence of Christ,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002011,'so that we might not be exploited by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his schemes.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002012,'Now when I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, a door was opened for me in the Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002013,'But I had no rest in my spirit because I did not find my brother Titus. So I took leave of the people there and went on to Macedonia.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002014,'But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of Christ everywhere.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002015,'For we are a sweet fragrance of Christ ascending to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002016,'to the latter we are a smell of death leading to death, but to the former we are a fragrance of life leading to life. And who is equal to such a task?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002017,'For we are not like others who peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak with sincerity in the presence of God, as men sent from God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003001,'Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you or letters of recommendation from you?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003002,'You are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003003,'You show that you are a letter from Christ, delivered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on stone tablets, but on tablets of human hearts.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003004,'Such is the confidence that we have in God through Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003005,'Not that we are competent in and of ourselves to claim that anything comes from us, but our competence comes from God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003006,'He has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003007,'Now if the ministry of death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the sons of Israel could not gaze at the face of Moses because of its glory (a glory that was fading away),'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003008,'will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003009,'For if the ministry of condemnation was glorious, the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory even more.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003010,'For what was once glorious now has no glory in comparison with the glory that surpasses it.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003011,'And if what was fading away came with glory, what remains will be even more glorious.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003012,'Therefore, since we have such a hope, we act with great boldness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003013,'We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel would not gaze at the end of what was fading away.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003014,'But their minds were hardened, for to this day the same veil remains unlifted when the old covenant is read. Only in Christ is this veil taken away.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003015,'But to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies over their hearts.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003016,'But whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003017,'Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003018,'And we all, with unveiled faces reflecting the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another; this comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004001,'Therefore, since we have this ministry through God''s mercy, we do not lose heart.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004002,'Rather, we have renounced shameful hidden deeds; we do not act deceitfully or distort the word of God, but by openly proclaiming the truth we commend ourselves to everyone''s conscience in the sight of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004003,'But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled among those who are perishing.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004004,'The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers like them, so that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, might not dawn upon them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004005,'For what we preach is not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus'' sake.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004006,'For God, who commanded light to shine out of darkness, has shone in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004007,'But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that this extraordinary power is from God and not from us.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004008,'We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004009,'persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004010,'always carrying about in our bodies the death of the Lord Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our bodies.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004011,'For we who live are always being delivered up to death for Jesus'' sake, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our mortal flesh.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004012,'So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004013,'It is written, “I believed, therefore I spoke.” With that same spirit of faith we also believe, therefore we also speak.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004015,'All of this is for your benefit, so that grace, as it extends to more and more people, may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004016,'Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though on the outside we are wasting away, on the inside we are being renewed day by day.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004017,'For our light and momentary affliction is bringing about for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all measure,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004018,'as we look not to what is seen, but to what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005001,'Now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not made by human hands.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005002,'For in this tent we groan, longing to be further clothed with our heavenly dwelling,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005003,'because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005004,'For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, not because we want to be unclothed, but further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005005,'Now he who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has also given us the Spirit as a guarantee.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005006,'Therefore we have courage at all times, and we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005007,'For we walk by faith, not by sight.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005008,'Yes, we have courage and would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005009,'Therefore, whether we are at home or away, we aspire to be pleasing to him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005010,'For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive his due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005011,'Therefore, because we know what it is to fear the Lord, we persuade others. What we are is known to God, and I hope that it is known in your consciences as well.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005012,'For we are not commending ourselves to you again, but we are giving you an opportunity to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearances and not about matters of the heart.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005013,'If we are out of our mind, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005014,'For the love of Christ compels us, because we have concluded that if one died for all, then all have died.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005015,'And he died for all so that those who live may no longer live for themselves, but for him who died for them and was raised.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005016,'So from now on we regard no one according to the flesh. Even if we have known Christ according to the flesh, we no longer know him in that way.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005017,'Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. Old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005018,'And all these things are from God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005019,'namely, that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people''s trespasses against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005020,'Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us. We plead on Christ''s behalf: “Be reconciled to God.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005021,'For God made him who did not know sin to be a sin offering for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006001,'As God''s fellow workers, we urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006002,'For he says, “At a favorable time I listened to yo?, and in a day of salvation I helped yo?.” Behold, now is the favorable time; now is the day of salvation.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006003,'We are putting no obstacle in anyone''s way, so that our ministry may not be discredited.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006004,'Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006005,'in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in sleepless nights, in hunger,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006006,'in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006007,'in the word of truth, in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness for the right hand and the left,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006008,'through glory and dishonor, through bad report and good report; regarded as deceivers, and yet true;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006009,'as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and yet not put to death;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006010,'as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing everything.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006011,'O Corinthians, we have spoken freely to you; our hearts have been opened wide.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006012,'You are not restricted by us, but by your own affections.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006013,'Now in return—I am speaking as I would to my own children—open your hearts to us.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006014,'Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership is there between righteousness and lawlessness? What fellowship does light have with darkness?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006015,'What harmony does Christ have with Belial? What portion does a believer have with an unbeliever?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006016,'And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For you are the temple of the living God, just as God said, “I will dwell in them and walk among them. I will be their God, and they will be my people.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006017,'Therefore, come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006018,'I will be a father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to me, says the Lord Almighty.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007001,'Therefore, since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of the flesh and spirit, bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007002,'Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007003,'I do not say this to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts so that we die together with you and live together with you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007004,'Great is my boldness toward you; great is my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort; I am overflowing with joy in all our affliction.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007005,'For even when we came to Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were afflicted at every turn, with conflicts on the outside and fears within.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007006,'But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the arrival of Titus,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007007,'and not only by his arrival, but also by the comfort you had given him. He told us about your longing, your contrition, and your deep concern for me, so that I rejoiced all the more.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007008,'For even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it (though I did regret it, for I see that my letter caused you sorrow, though only for an hour).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007009,'But now I rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to the point of repentance. For you felt a godly sorrow, so that you suffered no loss through us.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007010,'For godly sorrow produces a repentance that leads to salvation, leaving no regret, but worldly sorrow produces death.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007011,'Consider what earnestness this godly sorrow of yours has produced in you, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what zeal, what righting of wrong! In everything you have shown yourselves to be clear in the matter.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007012,'So although I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did the wrong, nor on account of the one who was wronged, but so that your earnestness for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007013,'In this we find comfort. And in addition to the comfort we received from you, we rejoiced all the more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007014,'For if I made any boast to him about you, I was not put to shame. But just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus has also proven to be true.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007015,'And his affection for you is even greater when he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007016,'I rejoice, because I have complete confidence in you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008001,'Now we make known to you, brothers, the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008002,'During a severe trial of affliction, their abundant joy and their deep poverty abounded in a wealth of generosity on their part.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008003,'For I testify that according to their ability, and even beyond their ability, they gave of their own accord,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008004,'urgently begging us for the privilege of contributing to the gift for the saints in Jerusalem.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008005,'And they did not do this in the way we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us by the will of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008006,'So we have urged Titus, who previously encouraged you to begin gathering money, to return and help you complete this gracious gift.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008007,'But just as you abound in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness, and in your love for us—make sure you abound in this gracious gift as well.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008008,'I am not saying this as a command, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008009,'For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by his poverty you could become rich.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008010,'So I am giving my advice about what is best for you in this matter. Last year you were not only the first who wanted to give, but you were also the first to begin doing so.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008011,'Now finish doing it, so that your eager willingness to give may be matched by your completion of the gift, according to what you have.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008012,'For if the eager willingness is there, it is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one does not have.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008013,'I do not mean there should be relief for others and hardship for you, but it is a matter of equality. At the present time your abundance should provide for their need,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008014,'so that in turn their abundance may provide for your need, and thus there may be equality.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008015,'As it is written, “He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008016,'But thanks be to God, who has put into the heart of Titus the same earnest care for you that I have.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008017,'For Titus not only accepted our appeal, but with great enthusiasm he is coming to you of his own accord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008018,'With him we are sending the brother who is praised by all the churches for his preaching of the gospel.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008019,'And not only that, but he has also been appointed by the churches to travel with us as we administer this gracious gift for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our eager willingness to help.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008020,'We are taking this precaution so that no one will discredit us with respect to this large sum that we are administering.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008021,'For we are giving careful thought to do what is right, not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008022,'We are also sending with them our brother whom we have often tested and found to be earnest in many matters, and now he is even more earnest because of his great confidence in you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008023,'If there is any question about Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker in your service. If there is any question about our brothers, they are delegates of the churches, the glory of Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008024,'Therefore show them in front of all the churches the proof of your love and the reason for our boasting about you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009001,'There is no need for me to write to you about this ministry of giving to the saints in Jerusalem.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009002,'For I know how eager you are to help, and I keep boasting about you to the Macedonians, saying that Achaia has been prepared to give since last year; and your zeal has stirred up most of them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009003,'But I have sent the brothers so that our boasting about you in this matter may not prove to be empty, but that you may be prepared, just as I said you would be.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009004,'Otherwise, if any of the Macedonians were to come with me and find you unprepared, we (not to mention you) would be ashamed of this confident boasting.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009005,'So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance your previously announced blessing, so that this gift of yours may be ready as a blessing and not as something you feel forced to do.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009006,'My point is this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009007,'Each person should give as he decides in his heart, not with sadness or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009008,'And God is able to provide you with every blessing in abundance so that you will always have everything you need to abound in every good work.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009009,'As it is written, “He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009010,'Now may he who provides seed to the sower, and bread for food, also multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009011,'May you be enriched in every way to be generous on every occasion, and through us may your generosity produce thanksgiving to God!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009012,'For this ministry of giving is not only providing for the needs of the saints in Jerusalem but is also abounding through many thanksgivings to God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009013,'By their approval of this ministry, the saints in Jerusalem will glorify God because of your submission to the gospel of Christ that you confess, and also because of your generous contribution to them and to all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009014,'They will pray for you with deep affection because of the surpassing grace of God that is upon you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009015,'Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010001,'Now I, Paul, myself appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ—I who am humble when with you face to face, but bold toward you when absent!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010002,'I ask that when I am present I need not show boldness by daring to oppose those who think that we walk according to the flesh.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010003,'For though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010004,'For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but are powerful in God for tearing down strongholds.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010005,'We tear down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and we take every thought captive to the obedience of Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010006,'We are ready to punish any disobedience, once your obedience is complete.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010007,'Are you looking only at outward appearances? If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should remind himself that just as he belongs to Christ, so we also belong to Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010008,'For even if I boast somewhat further about our authority (which the Lord has given us for building you up and not for tearing you down), I will not be ashamed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010009,'For I do not want to seem as though I am trying to frighten you by my letters.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010010,'For, “His letters,” they say, “are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech amounts to nothing.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010011,'The people who say such things should realize that what we say in our letters when we are absent, we will demonstrate by our actions when we are present.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010012,'For we do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure themselves with one another and compare themselves to one another, they do not show good sense.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003007,'Therefore you must understand that those who have faith are the sons of Abraham.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003008,'Now the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “All the nations will be blessed in yo?.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003009,'So then, those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003015,'Brothers, let me give an example from everyday life: When a man-made covenant is ratified, no one annuls it or adds to it.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003016,'Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his descendant. Scripture does not say, “And to his descendants,” referring to many, but referring to one man it says, “And to yo?r descendant,” who is Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003017,'My point is this: The law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul a covenant previously ratified by God to Christ, so as to invalidate the promise.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003018,'For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by the promise; but God granted it to Abraham by a promise.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003019,'Why then was the law given? It was added because of transgressions, until the descendant should come to whom the promise had been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003020,'Now a mediator does not represent just one party, but God is one.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003021,'Is the law then opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, truly righteousness would have come through the law.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003022,'But the Scripture has confined all under sin, so that the promise might be given on the basis of faith in Jesus Christ to those who believe.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003023,'Now before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined until the faith that was to come would be revealed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003024,'The law, then, was our guardian until Christ came, so that we could be justified by faith.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003025,'But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003026,'for you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003027,'For all of you who were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003028,'There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003029,'And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham''s descendants and heirs according to the promise.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004001,'Now I say that as long as the heir is a child, he differs in no way from a slave, though he is the master of all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004002,'But he is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by his father.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004003,'In the same way also, when we were children, we were enslaved to the elements of the world.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004004,'But when the fullness of time came, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004021,'Tell me, you who wish to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004022,'For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and one by the free woman.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004024,'This can be explained allegorically, for these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; this is Hagar.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004025,'For Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem; she is in slavery with her children.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004026,'But the Jerusalem that is above is the free woman; she is the mother of us all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004027,'For it is written, “Rejoice, O barren woman, who has never given birth; break forth and shout, yo? who have never been in labor! For many are the children of the desolate woman, more than those of the woman who has a husband.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004028,'Now we, brothers, like Isaac, are children of the promise.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004029,'But just as at that time the child who was born according to the flesh persecuted the child who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now also.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002013,'We also give thanks to God without ceasing because, when you received the word of God that you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it truly is, the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002014,'For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, because you suffered the same things from your own countrymen that they did from the Jews,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002015,'who killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and who also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to all men'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002016,'by hindering us from telling the Gentiles how they can be saved. In this way they are always filling up the measure of their sins, but wrath has come upon them at last.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002017,'As for us, brothers, when we were bereaved of you for a brief hour (being physically absent, but with you in our hearts), we longed with great eagerness to see you face to face.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002018,'Therefore we wanted to come to you—certainly I, Paul, tried to do so again and again—but Satan hindered us.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002019,'For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting in the presence of our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002020,'Yes, you are our glory and joy!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003001,'Therefore, when we could bear it no longer, we thought it best to stay in Athens alone,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003003,'so that no one would be shaken by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we have been appointed to afflictions such as these.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003004,'In fact, when we were with you, we told you in advance that we were going to suffer affliction, and as you well know, it has now happened.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003005,'For this reason, when I could bear it no longer, I sent Timothy to find out about your faith, lest somehow the tempter had tempted you and our labor had been in vain.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003009,'How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our God because of you?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003010,'Night and day we pray earnestly that we may see you face to face and supply what is lacking in your faith.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003011,'Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way to you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003012,'May the Lord cause you to increase and abound in your love for one another and for all, just as we abound in our love for you.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004001,'Finally, brothers, we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus that, just as you learned from us how you ought to walk and to please God, you do so more and more.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004002,'For you know the commands we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004003,'It is God''s will that you be sanctified, that you abstain from fornication,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004004,'and that each of you know how to control your own body in holiness and honor,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004005,'not in lustful passion like the Gentiles who do not know God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004006,'In this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of his brother, because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as we told you before and solemnly warned you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004007,'For God did not call us to be impure, but to live in holiness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004008,'Therefore whoever rejects this command does not reject man but God, who has given his Holy Spirit to you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004009,'Now concerning brotherly love, you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004010,'And indeed you do love all the brothers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to do so more and more.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004011,'We urge you to aspire to lead a quiet life, to attend to your own affairs, and to work with your own hands, just as we commanded you,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004012,'so that you may walk properly toward outsiders and not be in need of anything.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004013,'But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who have fallen asleep, so that you may not be grieved like others who do not have hope.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004014,'For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, we also believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004015,'According to the word of the Lord, we declare to you that we who are alive, who are left behind until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004016,'For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004017,'Then we who are alive, who are left behind, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will always be with the Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004018,'Therefore encourage one another with these words.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005001,'Now concerning the times and seasons, brothers, you have no need for anything to be written to you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005002,'For you yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005003,'When people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come upon them suddenly, like labor pains upon a woman with child, and they will certainly not escape.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005004,'But you, brothers, are not in darkness so that this day should catch you like a thief.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005005,'You are all sons of light and sons of the day; we are not of the night or of the darkness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005006,'So then let us not sleep, as others do, but let us be watchful and sober.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005007,'For those who sleep, sleep at night; and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005008,'But since we are of the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005009,'For God has not appointed us to suffer wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005010,'who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we may live together with him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005011,'Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, even as you are doing.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005012,'Now we ask you, brothers, to recognize those who labor among you, who lead you in the Lord and admonish you,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005013,'and to regard them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace with one another.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005014,'And we urge you, brothers, to admonish those who are idle, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, and be patient toward all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005015,'Make sure no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always strive to do good to each other and to everyone else.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005016,'Rejoice always,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005017,'pray without ceasing,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353001006,'It is indeed right for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353001008,'With flaming fire he will inflict vengeance on those who do not know God and who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353002006,'And you know what is now restraining him so that he will be revealed in his own time.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002003,'how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? This salvation was first announced by the Lord, and it was confirmed to us by those who heard him.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002005,'For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002006,'But in one place someone has testified: “What is man that yo? are mindful of him, or the son of man that yo? care for him?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002007,'Yo? made him a little lower than the angels and crowned him with glory and honor;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002008,'yo? put everything in subjection under his feet.” In subjecting everything to him, God left nothing that is not subjected to him. But now we do not yet see everything subjected to him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002009,'But we do see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002010,'For in bringing many sons to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002011,'For he who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified all have one Father. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002013,'And again, “I will put my trust in him.” And again, “Here I am, with the children God has given me.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002014,'Therefore, since the children all have flesh and blood, Jesus himself took on flesh and blood as well, so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002015,'and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002016,'For surely it is not angels that he helps, but the descendants of Abraham.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002017,'Therefore he had to become like his brothers in every way, so that he could be a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, in order to make atonement for the sins of the people.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002018,'Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003001,'Therefore, holy brothers, you who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus Christ, the apostle and high priest of our confession,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003002,'who was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God''s house.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003003,'Yet Jesus is considered worthy of more glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003004,'For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003005,'Now Moses was faithful in all God''s house as a servant, which provided testimony to what would be spoken later.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003006,'But Christ is faithful over God''s house as a Son. And we are his house if indeed we hold our confidence firm to the end along with the hope in which we boast.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003007,'Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, “Today, if you hear his voice,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003009,'where your fathers tried me, tested me, and saw my works for forty years.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003010,'Therefore I was angry with that generation and said, ‘They always go astray in their hearts; they have not known my ways.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003011,'As I swore in my wrath, ‘They will not enter my rest!’”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003012,'Brothers, make sure that none of you has an evil heart of unbelief that turns away from the living God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003013,'But encourage one another each day, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003014,'For we have become sharers in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003015,'As it is said, “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003016,'For some did rebel when they heard God''s voice, but not all whom Moses led out of Egypt.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003017,'Now with whom was God angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003018,'And to whom did God swear that they would not enter his rest, if not to those who were disobedient?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003019,'So we see that it was because of their unbelief that they were not able to enter.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004001,'Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest remains open, let us proceed with fear so that none of you may be found to have fallen short of it.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004002,'For we also have received good news just as they did. But the message they heard did not benefit them, since they were not united by faith with those who listened.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004003,'For we who have believed enter that rest. As for the others, God has said, “As I swore in my wrath, ‘They will not enter my rest!’” Now God''s works have been finished from the foundation of the world.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004004,'For in one place it speaks about the seventh day as follows: “On the seventh day God rested from all his works.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004005,'But again, God says in the passage above: “They will not enter my rest!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004006,'Therefore, since God''s rest remains open for some to enter, and those who formerly received good news did not enter because of their disobedience,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004007,'he again designates a certain day, calling it “Today,” as he says through David much later, in the passage already quoted, “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004008,'For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004009,'So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004010,'For anyone who has entered God''s rest has rested from his own works, just as God rested from his.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004011,'Therefore let us make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall into the same pattern of disobedience.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004012,'For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the point of dividing soul from spirit, and joints from marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004013,'No creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give an account.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004014,'Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004015,'For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are, yet was without sin.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004016,'Therefore let us draw near to the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005001,'For every high priest taken from among the people is appointed to represent the people in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005002,'He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005003,'That is why he is obligated to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005004,'No one takes this honor for himself, but receives it when he is called by God, just as Aaron was.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005005,'In the same way, Christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest, but was appointed by the one who said to him, “Yo? are my Son; today I have begotten yo?.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005006,'And in another passage he says, “Yo? are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005007,'In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005008,'Even though he was the Son, he learned obedience from what he suffered.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005010,'and was designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005011,'On this topic we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become sluggish in hearing.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005012,'For though you ought to be teachers by this time, you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of the oracles of God. You need milk, not solid food.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005013,'Anyone who lives on milk is unacquainted with the teaching about righteousness, for he is an infant.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005014,'But solid food is for the mature, whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish between good and evil.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006001,'Therefore, let us leave behind the elementary teaching about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith in God,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006002,'and of instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006003,'And this we will do, if God permits.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006004,'For it is impossible to renew to repentance those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006005,'who have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the coming age,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006006,'and yet have fallen away, since, to their own harm, they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and exposing him to public shame.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006007,'For land that has drunk the rain that often falls upon it, and produces a crop useful to those for whom it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006008,'But land that bears thorns and thistles is worthless and on the verge of being cursed; its end is to be burned.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006010,'For God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the labor of love that you have shown toward his name by serving the saints, as you still do.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006011,'We want each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance of hope to the very end,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006012,'so that you will not be sluggish, but imitators of those who inherit the promises through faith and patience.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006013,'When God made his promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater to swear by, he swore by himself,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006014,'saying, “I will surely bless yo? and multiply yo?.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006015,'And so Abraham, having patiently endured, obtained the promise.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006016,'People swear by someone greater than themselves, and in all their disputes an oath is final for confirmation.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006017,'So when God wanted to show the unchangeable nature of his purpose even more clearly to the heirs of the promise, he guaranteed it with an oath,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006018,'so that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006019,'We have this hope as a sure and steadfast anchor for the soul. It enters into the inner sanctuary behind the veil,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006020,'where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us, because he has become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007001,'Now this Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. When Abraham was returning from the slaughter of the kings, Melchizedek met him and blessed him,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007002,'and Abraham gave him a tenth of all the spoils. His name means “king of righteousness,” but he is also “king of Salem,” which means, “king of peace.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007003,'He is without father, without mother, and without genealogy; there is no beginning to his days or end to his life. But resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest forever.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007004,'Consider how great this man must be, that even Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the spoils.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007005,'Now the law commands the sons of Levi who receive the priestly office to collect tithes from the people, that is, their brothers, even though their brothers are also descended from Abraham.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007006,'But Melchizedek, who was not among the descendants of Levi, received a tithe from Abraham. He also blessed Abraham, who had received the promises.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007007,'It is beyond all dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007008,'In the one case, tithes are received by mortal men, but in the other case, they are received by one who is attested to be living.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007009,'One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007010,'For Levi was still in the loins of his ancestor Abraham when Melchizedek met him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007011,'Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under this priesthood the people received the law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek rather than the order of Aaron?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007012,'For when the priesthood is changed, the law must also be changed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007013,'Now he of whom these things are spoken belongs to a different tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007014,'For it is clear that our Lord arose from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priesthood.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007015,'Now this point becomes even more clear when there arises another priest like Melchizedek,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007016,'one who has become a priest, not through a legal requirement concerning physical descent, but through the power of an endless life.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007017,'For God testifies, “Yo? are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007018,'The former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and ineffectiveness'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007019,'(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007020,'And none of this happened without an oath. Aaron''s descendants become priests without an oath,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007021,'but Jesus was made a priest with an oath by the one who said to him, “The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, ‘Yo? are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.’”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007022,'Accordingly, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007023,'Now the former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007024,'but because Jesus continues forever, he has a permanent priesthood.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007025,'Therefore he is able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007026,'It was fitting for us to have such a high priest, one who is holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007027,'He has no need, like the other high priests, to offer up daily sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. For he did this once for all when he offered up himself.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007028,'For the law appoints as high priests men who have weakness, but the word of the oath, which came after the law, appoints the Son, who has been made perfect forever.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358008001,'Now the main point of what we are saying is this: We have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the Majesty''s throne in heaven,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358008002,'where he serves as a minister of the holy places and the true tabernacle, which was set up by the Lord, not by man.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358008003,'For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; therefore, it was necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358008004,'For if he were on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there are already priests who offer gifts according to the law.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358008005,'They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things. For when Moses was about to build the tabernacle, he was warned by God, “Be sure to make everything according to the pattern that was shown to yo? on the mountain.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358008006,'But as it is, the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to the old priesthood as the covenant he mediates is superior to the old covenant, since it has been enacted on better promises.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358008007,'For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need to look for a second one.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358008008,'But finding fault with it, God says to the people, “Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358008009,'not like the covenant I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. For they did not continue in my covenant, so I had no regard for them, says the Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358008010,'For this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws into their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358008011,'No longer will a man teach his fellow citizen or his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358008012,'For I will be merciful toward their iniquities; their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358008013,'In speaking of “a new covenant,” he has made the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old will soon disappear.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009001,'Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009002,'For a tabernacle was prepared. In the first room were the lampstand, the table, and the bread of the Presence; this is called the Holy Place.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009003,'Behind the second veil was a room called the Holy of Holies.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009004,'It had a golden censer and the ark of the covenant, which was overlaid on all sides with gold. In the ark were the golden jar containing the manna, the rod of Aaron that had budded, and the tablets of the covenant.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009005,'Above the ark were the cherubim of glory, overshadowing the mercy seat. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009006,'When these things were all in place, the priests regularly entered the first room of the tabernacle, performing their sacred duties.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009007,'But into the second room, the high priest alone entered only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009008,'By this arrangement the Holy Spirit was showing that the way into the holy places had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009009,'This is a symbol for the present time, during which gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009010,'but deal only with food and drink, and various washings and regulations for the flesh, imposed until the time of reformation.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009011,'But when Christ came as high priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands (that is, not of this creation),'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009012,'he entered once for all into the holy places, not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009013,'For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are defiled, sanctify for the purification of the flesh,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009014,'how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify your consciences from dead works to serve the living God?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009015,'That is why he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009016,'For in the case of a will, it is necessary to establish the death of the one who made it,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009017,'because a will takes effect only after the person''s death; it is never in force while the person who made it is alive.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009018,'That is why even the first covenant was not inaugurated without blood.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009019,'For when Moses had proclaimed every commandment of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, along with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll itself and all the people,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009020,'saying, “This is the blood of the covenant that God has ordained for you.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009021,'In the same way, he sprinkled with blood the tabernacle and all the vessels used in worship.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009022,'Indeed, according to the law nearly everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no remission.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009023,'So it was necessary for the copies of the things in heaven to be purified with these sacrifices, but for the heavenly things themselves to be purified with better sacrifices than these.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009024,'For Christ did not enter holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true ones; he entered heaven itself, so that he might now appear before God on our behalf.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009025,'Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself many times, as the high priest enters the holy places year after year with blood that is not his own,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009026,'for then he would have had to suffer again and again since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to remove sin by the sacrifice of himself.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009027,'And just as it is appointed for men to die once and then face judgment,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009028,'so also Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are eagerly waiting for him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010001,'Since the law has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the true form of those things, the same sacrifices offered year after year can never perfect those who draw near to worship.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010002,'Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers would have been purified once and for all, and would no longer have any consciousness of their sins?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010003,'But year after year they are reminded of their sins by these sacrifices.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010004,'For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010005,'Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said, “Sacrifice and offering yo? did not desire, but a body yo? prepared for me;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010006,'in whole burnt offerings and sin offerings yo? took no pleasure.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010007,'Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come to do yo?r will, O God, as it is written about me in the scroll of the book.’”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010008,'In the passage above he says, “Sacrifice and offering, and whole burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor did you take pleasure in them” (although they are offered according to the law),'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010010,'By God''s will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010011,'Now every priest stands daily at service, offering again and again the same sacrifices that can never take away sins.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010012,'But when Christ had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010013,'where he is now waiting until his enemies are made a footstool for his feet.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010014,'For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010015,'The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010016,'“This is the covenant I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws on their hearts and write them on their minds.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010017,'Then he adds, “Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010018,'Now where there is remission of these, an offering for sin is no longer needed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010019,'Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010020,'by the new and living way he opened for us through the veil (that is, through his flesh),'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010021,'and since we have a great priest over the house of God,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010022,'let us draw near with true hearts, in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010023,'Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010024,'And let us consider how to spur one another on to love and good works,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010025,'not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010026,'For if we continue sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010028,'Anyone who has rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010029,'How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by someone who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, who has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010033,'At times you were publicly exposed to reproach and affliction, and at other times you were partners with those who were treated that way.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010034,'For you sympathized with me when I was in prison, and you accepted the plundering of your possessions with joy, knowing that you have for yourselves a better and lasting possession in heaven.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010035,'Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,360004001,'Therefore, since Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same mentality, because whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,360004003,'For we have spent enough of our lives doing what the Gentiles like to do, walking in sensual indulgences, evil desires, excesses of wine, revelries, drinking bouts, and illicit idolatries.'
