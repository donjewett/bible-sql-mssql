EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340001017,'So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David until the Babylonian captivity are fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian captivity until the Christ are fourteen generations.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340001018,'Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they joined together, she was found to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340001019,'Then Joseph her husband, being a just man and not wanting to humiliate her publicly, decided to repudiate her secretly.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340001020,'But while he pondered these things, wow, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream saying: “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to receive Mary as your wife, because that which has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340001021,'And she will give birth to a Son and you will call His name Jesus, because He will save His people from their sins.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340001022,'Now all this happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet should be fulfilled, namely:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340001023,'“Behold, the virgin will become pregnant and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel”, which being translated is, ‘God with us’.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340001024,'Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as that angel of the Lord commanded him and received his wife,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340001025,'but did not know her until she had given birth to her son, the firstborn. And he called His name JESUS.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002001,'Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men magi from the East came into Jerusalem,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002002,'saying: “Where is he who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the East and have come to worship him.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002003,'When Herod the king heard it he became agitated, and all Jerusalem with him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002004,'And gathering all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002005,'So they said to him: “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it stands written by the prophet:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002006,'‘And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are not at all the least among the rulers of Judah, for out of you will come a Ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.’ ”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002007,'Then Herod, calling the wise men secretly, determined from them the time when the star appeared.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002008,'And directing them to Bethlehem he said, “When you get there, search carefully for the young child; and should you find him, bring back word to me, so that I also may go and worship him.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002009,'So having heard the king they departed, and there was the star that they had seen in the East! It went before them until it arrived and stopped above where the young Child was.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002010,'Now when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002011,'And coming into the house they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and falling down they worshiped Him; and opening their treasures they presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense and myrrh.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002012,'Then, having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed for their own country by a different road.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002013,'Now when they had departed, again, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream saying: “Get up, take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt and stay there until I tell you; because Herod is about to seek the young Child to destroy Him!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002014,'So he got up and took the young Child and His mother by night and departed for Egypt.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002015,'And he was there until the death of Herod, so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet should be fulfilled, namely: “Out of Egypt I called my Son.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002016,'Then Herod, when he saw that he had been deceived by the wise men, became very angry, and he sent out and killed all the boys who were in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002017,'Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, namely:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002018,'“A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, weeping and great mourning; Rachel weeping for her children and not wanting to be comforted, because they are no more.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002019,'Now Herod having died, there, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002020,'saying: “Get up, take the young Child and His mother and go into the land of Israel, for those seeking the life of the young Child have died.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002021,'So he got up and took the young Child and His mother and went into the land of Israel.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002022,'But hearing that Archelaus was reigning over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream he proceeded into the region of Galilee.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340002023,'And upon arriving he settled in a city called Natsareth Branch-town, so that what was spoken through the prophets should be fulfilled, that He would be called a Natsorean Branch-man.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003001,'Now in those days John the Baptizer began preaching in the wilderness of Judea'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003002,'and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has come near!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003003,'For this is he who was referred to by the prophet Isaiah, saying: “A voice crying-out, ‘Prepare in the wilderness the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.’ ”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003004,'Now John actually used clothes made from camel''s hair and a leather belt around his waist; while his food was locusts and wild honey.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003005,'Then Jerusalem, all Judea and all the region of the Jordan went out to him,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003006,'and were being baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003007,'But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them: “Brood of vipers! Who tipped you off to flee from the coming wrath?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003008,'Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003009,'and don''t even think to say within yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as father,’ for I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003010,'Indeed, already the ax is being laid to the root of the trees. So every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003011,'“I baptize you with water unto repentance, but the One coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with Holy Spirit.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003012,'His winnowing shovel is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor and gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003013,'Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003014,'But John tried to dissuade Him saying, “I have need to be baptized by You, and You are coming to me?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003015,'But in answer Jesus said to him, “Permit it now, because thus it is appropriate to us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he permitted Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003016,'And having been baptized Jesus came up directly from the water, when wow, the heavens were opened to Him, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and alighting upon Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340003017,'And wow, a Voice from the heavens saying, “This is my Son, the beloved, in whom I am always well pleased!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004001,'Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tested by the devil.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004002,'And having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004003,'And coming to Him the tempter said, “Since you are the Son of God, command that these stones become loaves of bread.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004004,'But in answer He said, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but by every word coming out of God''s mouth.’ ”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004005,'Then the devil takes Him into the holy city and sets Him upon the pinnacle of the temple,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004006,'and says to Him, “Since you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written: ‘He will give orders to His angels about you, and they will lift you up on their hands, lest you strike your foot against a stone.’ ”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004007,'Jesus said to him, “It is also written: ‘You shall not test the Lord your God!’ ”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004008,'Again the devil takes Him to a very high mountain and shows Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004009,'And he says to Him, “All these things I will give to you, if You will fall down and worship me.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004010,'Then Jesus says to him: “Get behind me, Satan! For it is written: ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.’ ”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004011,'Then the devil leaves Him, and then, angels came and began ministering to Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004012,'Now hearing that John had been put in prison, Jesus departed into Galilee.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004013,'And leaving Natsareth behind, He went and took up residence in Capernaum by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004014,'so that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet should be fulfilled, namely:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004015,'“Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004016,'The people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and upon those sitting in the place and shadow of death light has dawned.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004017,'From then on Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has come near.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004018,'And walking by the Sea of Galilee He saw two brothers, Simon (the one called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a circular net into the sea (for they were fishermen).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004019,'And He says to them, “Follow me and I will make you fishers of men.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004020,'So leaving the nets immediately they followed Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004021,'And going on from there He saw two other brothers, James (the one of Zebedee) and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And He called them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004022,'So leaving the boat and their father immediately they followed Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004023,'Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the Gospel of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every illness among the people.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004024,'So His fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all who were sick—suffering with various diseases and torments, and being demonized and being moonstruck, and paralytics—and He healed them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340004025,'So large crowds followed Him—from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and beyond the Jordan.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005001,'Now seeing the crowds He went up on the mountain, and upon His sitting down His disciples approached Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005002,'And opening His mouth He started teaching them, saying:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005003,'“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005004,'Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005005,'Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005006,'Blessed are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness, for they will be filled.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005007,'Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005008,'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005009,'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005010,'Blessed are those who have been persecuted on account of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005011,'“Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and speak all kinds of evil against you, lying, because of Me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005012,'Rejoice and exult, because your reward in the heavens is great, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005013,'You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt becomes insipid with what will it be salted? It is then good for nothing except to be thrown out and trampled down by the people.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005014,'You are the light of the world. A city located upon a hill cannot be hidden.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005015,'Nor do they light a lamp and place it under the hamper, but on the lampstand, and it shines on everything in the house.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005016,'So also let your light shine before the people, so that they may see your good works and may glorify your Father, who is in the heavens.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005017,'“Do not suppose that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005018,'For assuredly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one iota nor one tittle shall pass away from the Law until everything happens.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005019,'Therefore, whoever annuls one of the least of these commandments and teaches that to the people will be called least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whoever does and teaches them, he will be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005020,'For I say to you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees you will absolutely not enter the kingdom of the heavens!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005021,'“You have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘You shall not murder, so whoever murders will be liable to the judgment.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005022,'But I say to you that whoever gets angry with his brother without cause will be liable to the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, ‘Numbskull!’ will be liable to the council. But whoever says, ‘You absolute idiot!’ will be liable to hell fire.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005023,'Therefore, if you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005024,'leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled with your brother and then, returning, offer your gift.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005025,'Be agreeable to your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him, lest the adversary hand you over to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005026,'Assuredly I say to you, you will by no means get out of there until you have paid the last penny.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005027,'“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005028,'But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005029,'So if your right eye is causing you to fall, tear it out and throw it away; because it is better for you that one of your members perish than that your whole body be thrown into hell.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005030,'And if your right hand is causing you to fall, cut it off and throw it away; because it is better for you that one of your members perish than that your whole body be thrown into hell.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005031,'It was said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005032,'But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for a case of fornication, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005033,'“Again you have heard that it was said to the ancients: ‘You shall not swear falsely, but you shall perform your oaths to the Lord.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005034,'But I say to you not to swear at all: neither by heaven, because it is God''s throne;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005036,'Nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005037,'But let your word be ‘yes yes’, ‘no no’; for whatever is more than these is from the malignant one. !!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005038,'“You have heard that it was said: ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005039,'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005040,'“And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have the cloak as well.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005041,'And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005042,'Give to him who asks you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005043,'“You have heard that it was said: ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005044,'But I say to you: love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005045,'that you may prove to be sons of your Father in the heavens; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and He sends rain on the just and the unjust.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005046,'For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005047,'And if you greet only your friends, what are you doing extra? Do not even the tax collectors do so?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340005048,'Therefore, you be perfect just as your Father in the heavens is perfect.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340006001,'“Be careful not to do your charitable giving before the people so as to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward from your Father who is in the heavens.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340006002,'Therefore, whenever you do charitable giving do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be praised by the people. Assuredly I say to you, they already have their reward.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340006003,'But when you do charitable giving do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340006004,'so that your charitable giving may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will Himself repay you openly.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340006005,'And whenever you pray do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners, so that they may be seen by the people. Assuredly I say to you that they already have their reward.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340006006,'But you, whenever you pray, go into your room, and having shut the door pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you openly.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340006007,'“But when you pray do not babble like the heathen; for they think that they will be heard for their many words.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340006008,'So do not be like them, because your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340006009,'Therefore, you pray like this: ‘Our Father who is in the heavens, let Your name be reverenced;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340006010,'let Your kingdom come, let Your will be done, on the earth just as in heaven.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340006011,'Give us today our daily bread;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340015013,'But in answer He said: “Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340015015,'Then Peter answered and said to Him, “Explain this parable to us.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340015016,'So Jesus said: “Are you also still without understanding?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340015017,'Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is expelled into the sewer?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340015018,'But the things coming out of the mouth actually come from the heart; those are the things that defile the man.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340015020,'These are the things that defile the man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340015021,'Going out from there Jesus withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340015022,'And then, a Canaanite woman coming from those parts cried out to Him saying: “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demonized.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340015032,'Then Jesus summoned His disciples and said: “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have already remained with me three days, and have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340016012,'Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340016013,'When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi He questioned His disciples saying, “Who do people say that I, the Son of the Man, am?”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340027019,'Now as he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, because I suffered a great deal in a dream today because of Him.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340027020,'But the chief priests and elders had persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabbas, but destroy Jesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340027021,'So the governor spoke up and said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” And they said, “Barabbas!”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340027024,'When Pilate saw that nothing was being gained but rather a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd saying: “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man. It''s your problem!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340027025,'So in answer all the people said, “His blood be upon us and upon our children!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340027026,'Then he released Barabbas to them, but Jesus, after flogging Him, he delivered to be crucified.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340027027,'Then the governor''s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison around Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340027028,'They stripped Him and put a scarlet cloak on Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340027029,'They plaited a crown out of thorns and put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand; and kneeling before Him they would mock Him saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340027031,'After they had mocked Him they took the cloak off Him and put His own clothes back on; and they led Him away to be crucified.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340027032,'Now as they went out they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon; they compelled him to carry His cross.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340027033,'Upon arriving at a place called Golgotha, which means ‘place of a skull’,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340027037,'And they put the charge against Him over His head in writing: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340027038,'Then they crucified two bandits with Him, one on His right and one on His left.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340027065,'So Pilate said to them, “You have a guard; go make it as secure as you can!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340027066,'So they went and secured the grave with the guard, having sealed the stone.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340028001,'Now after the Sabbath, at the dawning of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, came to see the tomb.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340028002,'Now then, a big earthquake had occurred, because an angel of the Lord, descending out of heaven, had come and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat on it!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340028003,'And his appearance was like lightning and his clothing as white as snow.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340028004,'So the guards were shaken for fear of him, and became like dead men.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,340028005,'Now the angel spoke up and said to the women: “Do not be afraid! I know that you are looking for the Jesus who was crucified.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341001009,'Well it happened in those days that Jesus came from Natsareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341001010,'And immediately upon coming up from the water He saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit, like a dove, descending upon Him.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341001014,'Now after John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee proclaiming the Gospel of the Kingdom of God,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341001016,'Then, as He was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother, of Simon, casting a circular net onto the water, for they were fishermen.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341001027,'And all were astounded, so that they questioned among themselves, saying: “What is this? What can this new doctrine be? Because with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341001028,'So His fame spread directly into the whole surrounding area of Galilee.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341001035,'Now very early, still night, He got up, slipped out, and went off to a solitary place, where He was praying.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341001036,'Simon and those with him hunted for Him,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341001037,'and upon finding Him they said to Him, “Everyone is looking for you.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341001038,'But He said to them: “Let us go to the neighboring towns, so I can preach there also; that is why I have come.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341001039,'He was constantly preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and also casting out demons.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341001040,'A leper came to Him, imploring Him, kneeling before Him and saying to Him, “If you want to, you are able to cleanse me.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341001041,'So being moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him, and said to him: “I want to; be cleansed!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341001042,'And when He said this, immediately the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341001043,'And He sent him away at once, sternly warning him,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341001045,'However he went out and began to proclaim it freely, spreading the news, so that He was no longer able to enter a town openly, but remained outside in deserted places; yet they kept coming to Him from all over.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341002001,'Well a few days later, He again entered Capernaum, and it was heard that He was at home.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341002002,'Without delay so many were gathered together that there was no more room, not even around the door, and He was speaking the Word to them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341002003,'Then four men came, carrying a paralytic to Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341002004,'And not being able to get near Him because of the crowd, they removed the roof where He was; upon breaking through they lowered the pallet on which the paralytic was lying.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341002005,'So seeing their faith Jesus says to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven you.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341002006,'Now some of the scribes were sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts:'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341002008,'Immediately Jesus perceived in His spirit what they were reasoning within themselves and said to them: “Why are you reasoning these things in your hearts?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341002009,'Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins have been forgiven’, or to say, ‘Get up, pick up your pallet and start walking!’?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341002010,'But so that you may know that the Son of the Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins”—He says to the paralytic:'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341002012,'So forthwith he got up, picked up his pallet and went out in front of them all; so that all were amazed and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341002013,'Then He went out again by the sea; and the whole crowd came to Him, and He began to teach them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341002014,'As He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and He said to him, “Follow me!” So he got up and followed Him.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341003003,'Well, He says to the man with the withered hand, “Come out in the middle!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341003004,'Then He said to them: “Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” But they remained silent.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341003005,'After looking around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardness of their hearts, He says to the man, “Stretch out your hand!” So he stretched, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341003006,'Then the Pharisees went straight out, and with the Herodians started hatching a plot against Him, how they might destroy Him.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341003035,'Because whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, my sister, my mother.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004001,'Once again He began to teach beside the sea. And a large crowd was gathered to Him, so that He got into the boat and sat down, out on the water, while the whole crowd was on the land, at the water''s edge.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004002,'Then He began teaching them many things by parables and said to them in His teaching:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004003,'“Listen! Yes, a sower went out to sow.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004004,'And it happened, as he sowed, that some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004005,'Some fell on the rocky area where it did not have much soil, and it sprang up quickly because it had no depth of soil.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004006,'But upon the sun''s rising it was scorched, and because it had no root it was withered up.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004007,'And some fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and smothered it, and it yielded no fruit.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004008,'And some fell into the good ground, and coming up and growing it started to produce fruit—yielding thirty times as much, sixty times as much, even a hundred times as much.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004009,'Then He said, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004010,'But when He was alone, those who were around Him, with the twelve, asked Him about the parable.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004011,'So He said to them: “To you it has been given to know the mystery of the Kingdom of God; but to those who are outside, everything is being given in parables,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004012,'so that: ‘Seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; so that they should not return and their sins be forgiven them.’ ”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004013,'Then He said to them: “Don''t you understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004014,'The sower sows the Word.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004015,'These are the ones where the Word is sown along the path: as soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the Word that was sown in their hearts.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004016,'Similarly, these are the ones sown on the rocky area: as soon as they hear the Word they receive it with joy,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004017,'but since they have no root in themselves they are temporary—when oppression or persecution comes because of the Word, they quickly fall away.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004018,'And these are the ones sown among the thorns: they hear the Word,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004019,'but the worries of this age, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the undue desires for other things come in and smother the Word, and it becomes unfruitful.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004020,'And these are the ones sown on the good ground: such people hear the Word, welcome it and produce fruit—thirty times as much, sixty times as much, even a hundred times as much.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004021,'Also He said to them: “The lamp is not brought to be put under a box or under a bed, is it? Is it not to be placed on its stand?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004022,'For there is no ‘hidden’ that may not be exposed, nor has anything been concealed but that it should come to light.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004023,'If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004024,'Then He said to them: “Pay attention to what you hear. With the same measure you use it will be measured to you in return; and to you who hear, more will be added.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004025,'Because whoever has, to him more will be given; whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004026,'He also said: “The Kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter the seed on the ground'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004027,'and should sleep and get up night and day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he himself does not know how.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004028,'All by itself the earth produces fruit: first a shoot, then a head of grain, then full grain in the head.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004029,'But as soon as the grain is ready, he sends in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004030,'Again He said: “To what shall we compare the Kingdom of God, or with what sort of parable should we illustrate it?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004031,'It is like a mustard seed, that when it is sown on the ground is the smallest of all such seeds,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004032,'yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden herbs and produces big branches, so that the birds of the air are able to rest in its shade.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004033,'It was with many such parables that He was speaking the word to them, as they were able to hear it.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004034,'But apart from a parable He did not speak to them; privately, however, He would explain everything to His disciples.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004035,'On the same day, when evening had come, He said to them, “Let us go across to the other side.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004036,'Since He was already in the boat, they took off with Him, leaving the crowd behind (other little boats were also with Him).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004037,'Well a strong cyclonic wind came up, such that the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling up.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004038,'But He was on the poop deck, sleeping on the cushion; so they awakened Him and said to Him, “Teacher, don''t you care that we are perishing?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004039,'Then, having been awakened, He rebuked the wind and said to the sea, “Shut up; be muzzled!” So the wind stopped and there was a complete calm.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004040,'And He said to them: “Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341004041,'They were terrified and started saying to one another, “Who can this be, that even the wind and the sea obey Him!?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005001,'Then they came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gadarenes.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005002,'And when He got out of the boat, right away a man with an unclean spirit met Him, coming from the tombs.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005003,'—He had his dwelling among the tombs. No one could bind him, not even with chains,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005004,'because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, only to have had the chains torn apart by him, and the shackles broken in pieces; no one had been strong enough to tame him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005005,'Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out and cutting himself with stones.—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005006,'When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and kneeled down to Him,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005007,'and with a loud cry he said: “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore you by God, don''t torment me!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005008,'Because He was saying to him, “You unclean spirit, come out of the man!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005009,'Then He asked him, “What is your name?” And he answered, saying, “Legion is my name, because we are many.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005010,'He started begging Him repeatedly that He would not send them out of that region.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005011,'Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005012,'So all the demons begged Him saying, “Send us into the pigs, so that we may enter them.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005013,'And forthwith Jesus gave them permission; and coming out the unclean spirits went into the pigs (there were about two thousand); but the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned by the sea.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005014,'So those who were tending the pigs ran off and reported it in the town and the countryside. And they went out to see what it was that had happened.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005015,'They came to Jesus and observed the man who had been demonized, who had the legion, sitting and clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005016,'Those who had seen it related to them how it happened to the demonized man, and about the pigs.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005017,'Then they began to implore Him to depart from their borders.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005018,'Well upon His getting into the boat, the man who had been demonized started begging Him that he might be with Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005019,'But Jesus did not permit him, but said to him, “Go home to your family and report to them how much the Lord has done for you; and He had mercy on you.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005020,'So he departed and began to proclaim in Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him; and all were marveling.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005021,'Now when Jesus had crossed over again by boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered to Him; and He was by the sea.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005022,'And then, one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, comes, and upon finding Him he falls at His feet'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005023,'and pleads earnestly with Him, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death; do come and lay your hands on her so that she may be saved, and she will live.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005024,'So He went with him. A large crowd was also following Him, and they were pressing around Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005025,'Now a certain woman—who had been bleeding for twelve years,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005026,'and had suffered many things under many doctors, and had spent all that she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005027,'when she heard about Jesus, she came from behind in the crowd and touched His garment.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005028,'(She had kept saying, “If I can just touch His clothes, I will be healed.”)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005029,'Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she knew in her body that she was healed from the affliction.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005030,'And instantly Jesus perceived within Himself that some power had gone out of Him, and turning around in the crowd He said, “Who touched my clothes?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005031,'So His disciples said to Him, “You see the crowd pressing around you, yet you say, ‘Who touched me?’?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005032,'But He kept looking around to see who had done it.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005033,'So the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005034,'And He said to her: “Daughter, your faith has saved you. Go into peace and be healed from your affliction.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005035,'While He was still speaking, they came from the synagogue ruler''s house saying: “Your daughter died. Why trouble the teacher further?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005036,'But immediately upon hearing the spoken message Jesus said to the synagogue ruler, “Don''t be afraid; just believe!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005037,'He allowed no one to follow Him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005038,'Then He came to the synagogue ruler''s house and found a commotion—weeping and loud wailing.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005039,'So upon entering He said to them: “Why are you making such a commotion and weeping? The child is not dead, but is asleep.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005040,'But they started ridiculing Him. After He put them all out, He took the child''s father and mother, and those with Him, and went in where the child was lying.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005041,'And taking the child by the hand He said to her, “Talitha koumi,” which is translated, “Little girl, I say to you, get up!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005042,'Immediately the girl got up and started walking around (she was twelve years old). And they were overcome with great amazement.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341005043,'He gave them strict orders that no one should know about it, and said to give her something to eat.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006001,'Then He went out from there and came to His hometown, and His disciples followed Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006002,'And when the Sabbath came He began to teach in the synagogue. And many who heard were astonished, saying: “Where did this man get these things? What wisdom is this that is given to him? Such mighty works are being performed by his hands!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006003,'Isn''t this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judas and Simon? And aren''t his sisters here with us?” So they took offense at Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006004,'But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown, among his relatives, even in his own house.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006005,'He could do no mighty work there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006006,'And He marveled at their unbelief. Then He went about the villages in a circuit, teaching.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006007,'Then He summoned the twelve and began to send them out, two by two, giving them authority over the unclean spirits as He did so.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006008,'And He commanded them to take nothing for the road, except just a staff—no knapsack, no bread, no coin in the belt—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006009,'but to wear sandals, and not put on two tunics.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006010,'And He said to them: “Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you depart from that place.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006011,'And whoever will not receive you nor hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your feet as a testimony against them. Assuredly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah on Judgment Day than for that city.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006012,'So they went out and started preaching that people should repent,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006013,'and they were casting out many demons, and anointing with oil and healing many who were sick.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006014,'Now King Herod heard of Him, because His name had become well known, and he said, “John the Baptizer has been raised from the dead, and that is why the powers are at work in him.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006015,'Others said, “He is Elijah.” Still others said, “He is a prophet like one of the prophets.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006016,'But when Herod heard, he said: “This is John, whom I beheaded; he has been raised from the dead!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006017,'You see, Herod himself had ordered John arrested, and bound him in prison, on account of Herodias, his brother Philip''s wife; because he had married her'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006018,'—John had kept saying to Herod, “It isn''t lawful for you to have your brother''s wife.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006019,'So Herodias nursed a grudge against him and wanted to kill him; but she couldn''t,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006020,'because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a just and holy man. And consulting him he would do many things; indeed, he would hear him with pleasure.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006021,'Then an opportune day came when on his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his courtiers, the military commanders, and the chief men of Galilee.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006022,'When the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, and pleased Herod and those reclining with him, the king said to the girl, “Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006023,'He even swore to her, “Whatever you may ask me I will give you, up to half of my kingdom!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006024,'So she went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask?” And she said, “The head of John the Baptist!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006025,'Hurrying in directly to the king she requested, saying, “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006026,'Though the king became very sorry, because of his oaths and of his guests he did not want to refuse her.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006027,'Immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded the head to be brought. So he went and beheaded him in the prison,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006028,'brought the head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006029,'Upon hearing of it, his disciples came, removed the corpse and placed it in a tomb.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006030,'Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and reported all to Him, both what they had done and what they had taught.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006031,'Because so many were coming and going that they did not even have leisure to eat, He said to them, “Come aside by yourselves to a deserted place and rest awhile.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006032,'So they went away in the boat by themselves to a deserted place.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006033,'But many saw them going and recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns and arrived before them, and came together to Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006034,'Well upon disembarking Jesus saw a large crowd and was moved with compassion for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and He began to teach them many things.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006035,'When it was late in the day, His disciples came to Him and said: “This is a deserted place, and the hour is already late.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006036,'Send them away so they may go to the surrounding farms and villages and buy themselves bread; for they have nothing to eat.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006037,'But in reply He said to them, “You feed them!” They say to Him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and feed them?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006038,'So He says to them: “How many loaves do you have? Go and see.” When they knew they said, “Five, and two fish.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006039,'Then He directed them all to recline in groups on the green grass.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006040,'So they reclined in ‘plots’ of hundreds and of fifties.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006041,'And taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to His disciples to serve the people; He also divided the two fish among them all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006042,'Well they all ate and were filled.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006043,'And they picked up twelve full baskets of broken pieces; also of the fish.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006044,'There were five thousand men who ate the loaves.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006045,'Immediately He made His disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He dismissed the crowd.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006046,'And after taking leave of them He went up the mountain to pray.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006047,'Now when evening had passed, the boat was in the middle of the sea; and He was alone on the land.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006048,'And He saw them straining at rowing, because the wind was against them. Well about the fourth watch of the night He comes to them walking on the water, and would have passed by them;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006049,'but they saw Him walking on the water, supposed He was a ghost, and yelled!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006050,'Because they all saw Him and were terrified. Immediately He spoke with them and said: “Have courage! It is I; don''t be afraid!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006051,'Then He got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were totally astounded within themselves, and kept marveling.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006052,'Because they had not understood about the loaves—their hearts had been hardened.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006053,'After they had crossed over, they came to the land of Genesaret and anchored there.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006054,'When they came out of the boat, immediately the people recognized Him,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006055,'and running about that whole surrounding region they began to carry about on their pallets those who were sick to wherever they heard He was.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341006056,'Wherever He entered—into villages, towns, or countryside—they would place the sick in the marketplaces, and they would beg Him that they might just touch the hem of His garment; and all who touched Him were healed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007001,'Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered around Him, having come from Jerusalem.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007002,'And upon seeing some of His disciples eating bread with ‘unclean’—that is, ceremonially unwashed—hands, they found fault.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007003,'(Because the Pharisees, indeed all the Jews, do not eat unless they wash their hands in a special way, holding to the tradition of the elders.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007004,'When they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other things they have received and hold—washings of cups, pitchers, copper vessels and couches.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007005,'Then the Pharisees and the scribes asked Him, “Why don''t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007006,'So in answer He said to them: “Well did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites, as it stands written: ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007007,'But in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007008,'Because having left the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men—washings of pitchers and cups, and many other similar things that you do.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007009,'Indeed He said to them: “You are very good at nullifying the commandment of God, so that you may keep your tradition.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007010,'For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’ and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007011,'But you say that if a man should say to father or mother, ‘Whatever profit you might have received from me is Korban’ (that is, a gift to God),'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007012,'you don''t even allow him to do anything for his father or his mother any more,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007014,'Upon summoning the larger crowd He said to them: “Hear me, everyone, and understand:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007015,'There is nothing outside a man that can defile him by going into him; rather, the things that come out of him, those are the ones that defile him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007016,'If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007017,'When He had entered a house away from the crowd, His disciples started to question Him about the parable.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007018,'So He said to them: “Can you really be without understanding? Don''t you perceive that nothing that enters a man from outside can defile him,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007019,'because it doesn''t go into his heart, but into his stomach, which then expels the impure aspects of the food?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007020,'He went on to say: “That which comes out of a man, that is what defiles him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007021,'Because from within, out of men''s hearts, the evil designs proceed—adulteries, fornications, murders,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007022,'thefts, covetings, malignancies; deceit, lewdness, an evil eye, blasphemy, arrogance, foolishness—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007023,'all these malignant things proceed from within and defile the man.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007024,'Then He got ready and went from there into the region of Tyre and Sidon. He went into a house and did not want anyone to know it, but He could not escape notice.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007025,'In fact, as soon as she heard about Him, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit came and fell at His feet.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007026,'Now the woman was a Greek, a Syro-Phoenecian by birth, and she kept asking Him to cast the demon out of her daughter.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007027,'But Jesus said to her, “Let the children be filled first; it is not good to take the children''s bread and throw it to the little dogs.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007031,'Again, departing from the region of Tyre and Sidon, Jesus came to the Sea of Galilee by way of the Decapolis region.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007032,'Then they brought to Him a deaf man with thick speech and begged Him to place His hand on him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007033,'After taking him aside, away from the crowd, He put His fingers in his ears; He also spat and touched his tongue.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007034,'Then looking up to heaven He sighed, and said to him, “Ephphatha!” that is, “Be opened!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007035,'Immediately his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he began to speak clearly.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007036,'Then He commanded them that they should tell no one; but the more He would command them, so much the more they would proclaim it.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341007037,'People were astonished beyond measure, saying: “He has done everything well. He makes both the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008001,'In those days, the multitude being very large and not having anything to eat, Jesus called His disciples and said to them:'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008003,'If I send them away hungry to their homes, they will give out on the way, because some of them have come a long distance.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008004,'His disciples answered Him, “From what source could anyone satisfy these people with bread here in a wilderness?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008005,'He asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” And they said, “Seven.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008006,'So He told the crowd to sit down on the ground; then taking the seven loaves and giving thanks, He broke them and gave them to His disciples to set before the crowd, and they did.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008007,'They also had a few small fish; so blessing them He said to distribute them as well.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008008,'Well they ate and were filled; they even took up seven hampers of broken pieces that were left over.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008009,'Now those who had eaten were about four thousand; and He sent them away.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008010,'Then He got right into the boat with His disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008011,'The Pharisees came out and began to argue with Him, requesting of Him a sign from heaven, by way of testing Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008012,'But He sighed deeply in His spirit and said: “Why does this generation seek a sign? I tell you emphatically, no sign shall be given to this generation!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008013,'Turning His back on them, He got back into the boat and went off to the other side.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008015,'And He charged them, saying, “Watch out; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008016,'So they started reasoning among themselves, saying, “It''s because we have no bread.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008017,'Being aware of it Jesus said to them: “Why are you reasoning because you have no bread? Do you still neither perceive nor understand? Do you still have hearts that have been hardened?'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008019,'When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you take up?” They say to Him, “Twelve.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008021,'So He said to them, “How is it that you still don''t understand?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008022,'Then He came to Bethsaida; and they brought a blind man to Him and begged Him to touch him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008023,'So He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village; then spitting into his eyes and laying hands on him, He asked him if he saw anything.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008024,'And looking up he said, “I do see men, only they look like walking trees.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008025,'Then He put His hands on his eyes again, and made him look up; and he was restored and saw everyone clearly.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008026,'Then He sent him away to his house, saying, “Neither go into the village nor tell anyone in the village.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008027,'Then Jesus and His disciples set out for the towns of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He questioned His disciples, saying to them, “Who are people saying that I am?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008028,'So they answered, “John the Baptist; others Elijah; still others one of the prophets.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008029,'He said to them, “And who do you say that I am?” So Peter answered and said to Him, “You are the Christ!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008030,'Then He charged them that they should tell no one about Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008031,'He then began to teach them that the Son of the Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008032,'He said these things quite plainly. Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008033,'But He turned, looked at His disciples, and rebuked Peter, saying: “Get behind me, Satan! You have in mind men''s values, not God''s values.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008034,'He summoned the crowd, along with His disciples, and said to them: “Whoever wants to follow along behind me must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008035,'Because whoever may resolve to ‘save’ his life will waste it; but whoever may ‘waste’ his life for my sake and the Gospel''s, he will save it.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008036,'Well, what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul?'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341008038,'Yes, whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of the Man will also be ashamed of Him whenever He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy Angels.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009002,'After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John and led them up on a high mountain alone by themselves. Then He was transfigured in front of them;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009004,'And Elijah appeared to them, along with Moses, and they were conversing with Jesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009005,'Well Peter reacted by saying to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; let us make three shelters: one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009009,'Now as they were coming down from the mountain, He ordered them not to recount to any one the things they had seen until the Son of the Man had risen from the dead.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009010,'So they kept this word to themselves, questioning what the ‘rising from the dead’ meant.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009011,'And they asked Him, saying, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009012,'So in answer He said to them: “Elijah indeed does come first, and restores all things; also how it is written concerning the Son of the Man that He must suffer many things and be treated with contempt.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009013,'Still, I say to you that ‘Elijah’ has also come, and they did to him as they wished, as it is written about him.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009014,'Upon coming to the disciples, He saw a large crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009015,'Well as soon as the crowd saw Him they were excited and ran to greet Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009016,'He asked the scribes, “What are you discussing with them?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009017,'In answer a man in the crowd said: “Teacher, I brought you my son, who has a mute spirit.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009019,'But He answered him by saying: “O unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you, how long shall I put up with you? Bring him to me!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009020,'So they brought him to Him. Upon seeing Him the spirit convulsed him, and falling to the ground he started wallowing, foaming at the mouth.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009021,'Then He asked his father, “How long has this been happening to him?” And he said: “From childhood.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009022,'Really, it has often thrown him both into fire and into water to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009023,'Jesus said to him, “It''s ‘if you can believe’; all things are possible to the one who believes.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009026,'Then it yelled, convulsed him violently, and came out. Well he looked to be dead; so much so that many said, “He''s dead.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009027,'But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he stayed on his feet.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009028,'Well upon His entering a house His disciples asked Him privately, “Why couldn''t we cast it out?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009029,'He said to them, “This kind can come out by nothing except prayer and fasting.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009030,'Having gone out from there they were passing through Galilee, and He did not want anyone to know;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009031,'because He was teaching His disciples and saying to them, “The Son of the Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men, and they will kill him; and once killed he will rise on the third day.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009032,'But they were not understanding this information, yet were afraid to ask Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009033,'Then He came to Capernaum; and once in the house He asked them, “What were you debating among yourselves on the road?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009034,'But they kept silent, because on the road they had debated among themselves who was greater.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009035,'So He sat down, called the twelve and said to them, “If anyone desires to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341009036,'Then He took a child and stood him in their midst, and embracing him said to them,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341010001,'Then He set out from there and came into the borders of Judea, by way of the other side of the Jordan. Again, crowds gathered to Him, and as was His custom, He began to teach them once more.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341010002,'Then some Pharisees approached to test Him and asked Him, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce a wife?”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341010010,'When they were in the house again, His disciples asked Him about the same subject.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341011027,'Then they came again to Jerusalem. And as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes and the elders came to Him.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,341012012,'So they started looking for a way to arrest Him, because they knew He had spoken the parable against them, but they were in fear of the crowd. Then they left Him and went away.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009031,'they appeared in glory and were explaining His ‘departure’, that He was about to bring to fruition in Jerusalem.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009032,'Now Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep; but becoming fully awake, they saw His glory, and the two men who stood with Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009033,'Then it happened: as they were parting from Him, Peter said to Jesus: “Master, it is good for us to be here” and “Should we make three shelters: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah?”—not knowing what he was saying.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009034,'But as he was saying this a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they became afraid as they entered the cloud.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009036,'When the Voice had ceased, Jesus was found alone. (They kept quiet and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009037,'Now it happened on the next day, when they came down from the mountain, that a large crowd met Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009038,'And then, a man from the crowd called out, saying: “Teacher, I beg you, look upon my son, for he is my only begotten.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009039,'And oh, a spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams, and it convulses him with foaming, and it hardly departs from him, destroying him!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009040,'And I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009041,'Then in answer Jesus said: “O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and put up with you (pl)? Bring your (sg) son here!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009042,'But while he was still coming the demon threw him down and convulsed him. Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the child, and gave him back to his father.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009043,'Everyone was amazed at the majesty of God. But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, He said to His disciples,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009045,'But they did not understand this saying; indeed it was concealed from them, in order that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him about it.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009046,'Then an argument started among them as to which of them would be the greatest.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009047,'So Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their heart, took a little child and had him stand beside Him,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009048,'and said to them: “Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me; and whoever receives me receives Him who sent me. Further, he who is least among all of you, he will be great.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009049,'Then John reacted by saying, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009050,'So Jesus said to him, “Do not forbid, because he who is not against us is for us.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009051,'Now it happened, as the days for His Ascension approached, that He set His face to go to Jerusalem,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009052,'and He sent messengers ahead of Him. And as they went, they entered a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009053,'But they did not receive Him, because He was heading for Jerusalem.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009054,'Well, when His disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven and consume them, just like Elijah did?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009055,'But He turned and rebuked them saying: “You do not know of what sort of spirit you are.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009056,'Further, the Son of the Man did not come to destroy men''s lives, but to save.” And they went to another village.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009057,'Now as they journeyed on the road, it happened that someone said to Him, “Lord, I will follow you wherever you go.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342009058,'So Jesus said to him, “The foxes have dens and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of the Man has no place to lay His head.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342010013,'“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! Because if the mighty works that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342011001,'Then it happened, when He finished praying in a certain place, that one of His disciples said to Him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342017018,'None were found to return and give glory to God except this foreigner!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342017019,'Then He said to him, “Get up and go; your faith has made you well.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342017020,'Now when He was asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come, He answered them and said: “The Kingdom of God does not come with observation;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342018001,'And then He told them a parable, the point being that one needs to always pray and not lose heart,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342018008,'I tell you that He will get justice for them quickly. However, when the Son of the Man comes, will He actually find the faith on the earth?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342018009,'Then He told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised the rest:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342018010,'“Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342018011,'The Pharisee stood and started praying to himself like this: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like all the rest—robbers, unjust, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342018013,'The tax collector, staying a good ways off, did not even venture to look up to heaven, but started beating on his chest, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me a sinner!’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342018014,'I say to you that this one went back home justified rather than that one; because everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342018015,'Then they even started bringing their babies to Him, that He might touch them; but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342018016,'But Jesus summoned them and said: “Allow the little children to come to me, and do not hinder them; because the Kingdom of God is of such.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342018036,'Hearing a crowd going by, he asked what it was.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342018037,'So they told him that Jesus the Natsorean was passing by.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342018043,'And immediately he did! and he followed Him, glorifying God. And all who witnessed it gave praise to God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019001,'He entered and started passing through Jericho.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019002,'A man named Zacchaeus was there—he was a chief tax collector, and he was wealthy!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019003,'He was trying to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, because he was short.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019004,'And running on ahead he climbed up into a sycamore tree, in order to see Him, since He was about to pass by there.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019005,'And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him, “Zacchaeus, come down quickly, because today I must stay at your house.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019007,'But when they saw it, they all started complaining, saying, “He has entered to lodge with a sinful man!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019008,'Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Indeed, Lord, I herewith give half of my goods to the poor, and if I have extorted anything from anyone, I restore fourfold.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019009,'So Jesus said about him, “Today salvation has happened in this house, in that he also is a son of Abraham;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019011,'Now as they heard these things, He continued with a parable, because He was near Jerusalem and they were supposing that the Kingdom of God was on the verge of being revealed.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019015,'It happened that he did receive the kingdom, and upon returning he ordered that those slaves to whom he had given the money be called to him, to know who had gained what by trading.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019016,'So the first one came and said, ‘Master, your mina earned ten minas!’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019017,'He said to him: ‘Super, you good slave! Because you were faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities!’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019018,'And the second one came and said, ‘Master, your mina made five minas.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019019,'Likewise he said to him, ‘You also be over five cities.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019020,'Then a different one came, saying: ‘Master, here is your mina, that I kept laid away in a piece of cloth'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019022,'So he said to him: ‘I will judge you out of your own mouth, you wicked slave! You knew that I am a hard man, removing what I did not place, and reaping what I did not sow.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019023,'Why then didn''t you put my money on deposit, and upon coming I would have collected it with interest?’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019024,'And to those standing by he said, ‘Take the mina from him and give it to him who has the ten minas.’'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019029,'When He drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mountain called ‘of Olives’, it happened like this: He sent two of His disciples,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019033,'As they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019034,'So they said, “The Lord needs it.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019035,'Then they brought it to Jesus; and throwing their own clothes on the colt, they placed Jesus on it.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019036,'And as He went along people were spreading their clothes on the road.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019037,'Then, as He was approaching the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019038,'saying: “Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019039,'Some of the Pharisees said to Him from the crowd, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019041,'Now as He approached, observing the city He wept over it,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019042,'saying: “If you, yes you, especially in this your day, had known the things pertaining to your peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019043,'Yes, the days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment around you; indeed they will surround you and hem you in on every side.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019044,'And they will raze you, and your children within you, to the ground—they will not leave in you one stone upon another—all because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342019045,'And upon entering the temple He began to drive out those who were selling and buying in it,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020001,'Now it happened on one of those days, as He was teaching and evangelizing the people in the temple, that the priests and scribes came to Him with the elders'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020002,'and addressed Him, saying, “Tell us by what authority you are doing these things; or who is he who gave you this authority?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020003,'But in answer He said to them: “I also will ask you one thing; yes, tell me:'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020007,'So they answered that they did not know where it was from.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020008,'And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020009,'Then He began to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, leased it to farmers, and went away on a long journey.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020010,'At the proper time he sent a slave to the farmers, that they might give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers flogged him and sent him away empty-handed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020011,'Again he sent a different slave; so they flogged him also, treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020012,'And again he sent a third; but they wounded him also and threw him out.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020013,'Then the owner of the vineyard said: ‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; hopefully they will respect him when they see him.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020014,'But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying: ‘This is the heir. Come, let''s kill him, so that the inheritance may become ours.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020015,'So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What therefore will the owner of the vineyard do to them?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020016,'He will come and destroy those farmers and give the vineyard to others.” Having heard it they said, “May it never be!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020017,'Then He looked directly at them and said: “What then is this that is written: ‘A stone that the builders rejected, the same became the cornerstone’?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020018,'Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but on whomever it should fall—it will crush him!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020019,'The chief priests and the scribes wanted to lay hands on Him right then, but they were afraid —they knew He had spoken this parable against them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020020,'Keeping a close watch on Him, they sent spies, who pretended to be innocent, so that they might latch on to something He said, so as to hand Him over to the power and the authority of the governor.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020021,'So they questioned Him, saying: “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and you do not show favoritism but teach the way of God in truth.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020022,'Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020023,'But He perceived their craftiness and said to them: “Why are you testing me?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020024,'Show me a denarius—whose image and inscription does it have?” In answer they said, “Caesar''s.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020025,'So He said to them, “Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar''s, and to God the things that are God''s.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020026,'They were unable to latch on to His word in front of the people; and marveling at His answer they kept silent.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020027,'Then some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is a resurrection, approached and questioned Him,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020028,'saying: “Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man''s married brother dies childless, then his brother should take the widow and produce offspring for his brother.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020029,'Now there were seven brothers: the first took a wife and died childless;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020030,'then the second took the widow and he died childless;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020031,'then the third took her, in fact all seven in sequence—they all died childless.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020032,'Finally, last of all, the woman died also.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020033,'Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be, since all seven had her?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020034,'So in answer Jesus said to them: “The people of this age marry and are given in marriage;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020036,'Because they cannot die anymore, being like angels—they are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020037,'But that the dead are raised, Moses indeed revealed about the Bush when he recorded: ‘The Lord, the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020038,'So He is not the God of the dead, but of the living—to Him all are alive.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020039,'Then some of the scribes answered and said, “Teacher, you spoke well.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020040,'And they no longer dared to question Him further.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020041,'Then He said to them: “How is it that they say that the Messiah is David''s Son?'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020044,'Since David calls Him ‘Lord’, how then is He his Son?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342020045,'Then, in the hearing of the people, He said to His disciples:'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342021001,'Looking up He saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasure chest.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342021002,'But He also saw a certain poor widow putting in two mites.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342021003,'So He said: “I tell you truly that this poor widow put in more than all of them;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342021004,'because all these others put in gifts for God out of their abundance, but she, out of her destitution, put in all she had to live on.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342021005,'Then, as some were admiring the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and donations, He said,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342021007,'So they asked Him, saying: “Teacher, so when will these things be?” and “What will be the sign when these things are about to happen?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342021008,'So He said: “Be careful, so as not to be deceived, because many will come in my name saying: ‘I am’ and ‘The time is at hand.’ Therefore do not go after them.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342022005,'They were glad, and agreed to give him silver coins.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342022006,'So he promised, and started looking for an opportunity to betray Him to them, without a crowd.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342022007,'Then came the day of unleavened bread, in which it was necessary to kill the Passover lamb.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342022008,'And He sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342022024,'Now there had actually been a discussion among them as to which of them seemed to be greater.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342022025,'So He said to them: “The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called ‘benefactors’.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342022062,'And going outside he wept bitterly.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342022063,'The men who were guarding Jesus started mocking and beating Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342022064,'And having blindfolded Him they would hit His face and ask Him, saying: “Prophesy! Who was it who struck you?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342022065,'And they kept saying many other insulting things to Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342022066,'As soon as it was day, the elders of the people, both the chief priests and scribes, came together and brought Him before their council, saying,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342022071,'Then they said: “What further testimony do we need? We ourselves have heard it from his mouth!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023001,'Then the whole crowd of them rose up and led Him to Pilate.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023002,'And they began to accuse Him, saying, “We found this fellow perverting the nation and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, declaring himself to be Christ, a king.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023003,'So Pilate questioned Him, saying, “Are you the king of the Jews?” In reply He said to him, “You said it!”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023006,'When Pilate heard ‘Galilee’, he asked if the man was a Galilean.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023007,'Upon learning that He belonged to Herod''s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023008,'Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was really pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see Him, having heard so many things about Him; and he was hoping to see some miracle performed by Him.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023010,'On their part, the high priests and scribes stood by, vehemently accusing Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023011,'Then Herod and his soldiers, after ridiculing and mocking Him, arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe and sent Him back to Pilate.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023012,'(That very day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other—previously having been at odds with each other.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023013,'Then Pilate, having called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023014,'said to them: “You have brought this man to me as one who misleads the people, and yet, having examined him in your presence, I have found no guilt in this man as to those things of which you accuse him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023015,'Further, neither did Herod (for I sent you on to him); indeed, nothing deserving of death has been done by him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023016,'I will therefore flog and release him.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023017,'(It was necessary for him to release one to them at the feast.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023018,'But they all cried out together, saying: “Away with this one! Release to us Barabbas!”—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023019,'who had been thrown into prison for a certain insurrection in the city, and for murder.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023020,'Then Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023021,'But they just kept shouting: “Crucify! Crucify him!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023022,'For the third time he said to them: “But what evil has this man done? I have found no reason for death in him. I will therefore flog and release him.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023023,'But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices that He be crucified! And their voices, especially of the chief priests, prevailed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023024,'So Pilate decided to grant their demand.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023025,'He released the one who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for; but he delivered Jesus to their will.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023026,'Now as they led Him away, they conscripted a certain Simon of Cyrene (coming in from a field), and put the cross on him to carry it behind Jesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023027,'A considerable crowd of people followed Him, including women who were also mourning and lamenting Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023028,'So Jesus turned to them and said: “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; rather weep for yourselves and for your children.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023029,'Because indeed, the days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, even the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023030,'Then they will begin ‘to say to the mountains, “Fall on us!” and to the hills, “Cover us!” ’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023031,'For if they do these things in the ‘green tree’, what will happen in the ‘dry’?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023032,'There were also two others, criminals, led with Him to be put to death.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023033,'When they arrived at the place called ‘The Skull’, they crucified Him there; also the criminals, one on His right, the other on His left.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023035,'Meanwhile the people stood looking on. And especially the rulers among them were sneering, saying, “He saved others; let him save himself, if such is the Christ, the chosen of God!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023036,'Yes, even the soldiers mocked Him, approaching and offering Him sour wine,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023037,'and saying, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023038,'In fact, above Him there was a written notice, in Greek, Latin and Hebrew letters: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023039,'Then one of the hanged criminals started berating Him, saying, “If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023040,'But the other reacted and rebuked him, saying: “Don''t you even fear God, since you are under the same condemnation?'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023042,'Then he said to Jesus, “Please remember me, Lord, when you come in your kingdom.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023043,'Jesus said to him, “I tell you assuredly, today you will be with me in Paradise.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023044,'Now it was about the sixth hour, and darkness came upon the whole land until the ninth hour.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023045,'Yes, the sun was darkened; also, the veil of the temple was torn in two.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342023046,'Then, after giving a loud shout, Jesus said, “Father, it is into your hands that I will commit my spirit.” And having said this, He breathed out His spirit.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342024005,'Then, as they were afraid and bowed their faces to the ground, they said to them: “Why do you seek the living One among the dead?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342024006,'He is not here, but is risen! Remember how He told you while still in Galilee,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342024008,'And they remembered His words.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342024009,'Then they returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the Eleven, and to all the rest.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342024010,'They were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them, who told these things to the apostles.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342024011,'But their words seemed to them like nonsense, and they disbelieved them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342024012,'(But Peter had gotten up and run to the tomb, and stooping down he saw the linen strips lying by themselves; and he departed, marveling to himself at what had happened.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342024013,'And then that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342024014,'And they were conversing with each other about all that had happened.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342024016,'But their eyes were restrained, in order that they not recognize Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342024017,'So He said to them, “What words are these that you are exchanging with one another as you walk, and are gloomy?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342024018,'Then the one whose name was Cleopas answered and said to Him, “Are you the only one living in Jerusalem who doesn''t know the things that have happened there in these days?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342024019,'He said to them, “What things?” So they said to Him: “The things concerning Jesus the Natsorean, how the man was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342024021,'And we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel! Further, besides all this, today is the third day since these things happened.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,342024029,'But they constrained Him, saying, “Stay with us, because it is toward evening, and the day is far spent.” So He went in to stay with them.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343001014,'So the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we observed His glory, glory of an Only-begotten, from the Father, full of grace and truth.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343002019,'Jesus answered and said to them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343002021,'But He was speaking about the temple of His body.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343002022,'Therefore, when He was raised from among the dead His disciples remembered that He had said this; so they believed the Scripture, even the word that Jesus had spoken.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343002023,'Now while He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed into His name, observing the signs that He was doing.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343002024,'But as for Jesus Himself, He did not entrust Himself to them, because He knew all men'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343002025,'and that He had no need that anyone should testify about man, because He Himself knew what was in man.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343003001,'Now there was a man among the Pharisees whose name was Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343003002,'The same went to Jesus at night and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that you have come as a teacher from God, because no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343003016,'Because God loved the world so much that He gave His only begotten Son, so that everyone who believes into Him should not be wasted, but should have eternal life.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343003017,'For God did not send His Son into the world in order to condemn the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343003018,'The one believing into Him is not condemned, but the one not believing has already been condemned, because he has not believed into the name of the only begotten Son of God.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343004039,'Now many of the Samaritans from that city believed into Him because of the word of the woman, testifying that “He told me everything I ever did!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343004040,'So when the Samaritans came to Him they urged Him to stay with them; and He did stay there two days.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343004043,'So after the two days He departed from there and went on into Galilee.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343004044,'(For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet does not have honor in his own country.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343004045,'So when He came into Galilee the Galileans welcomed Him, having seen all the things that He did in Jerusalem, at the festival; for they too had gone to the festival.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343004046,'So Jesus went again to Cana of Galilee, where He made the water wine. Now there was a certain royal official whose son was sick in Capernaum.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343004047,'When this man heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and implored Him to come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343004052,'So he inquired of them the hour in which he got better. And they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343004054,'Again, coming out of Judea into Galilee, Jesus performed this second miraculous sign.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005001,'After these things there was the feast of the Jews, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005002,'Now in Jerusalem, by the Sheep Gate, there is a pool called Bethesda, in Hebrew, which has five porches.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005003,'In them a large number of sick people were lying—blind, lame, paralyzed—waiting for the moving of the water;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005004,'because an angel would go down from time to time into the pool and stir up the water—then the first one to get in after the stirring of the water became well of whatever disease that was holding him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005005,'Now there was a certain man there who had been sick for 38 years.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005006,'Seeing this man lying there and knowing that he had already been sick a long time, Jesus says to him, “Do you want to get well?”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005009,'Immediately the man became well and picked up his pallet and started to walk!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005010,'But that day was a Sabbath, so the Jews said to the one who had been healed: “It''s the Sabbath! You aren''t allowed to carry the pallet.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005013,'But the man who was cured did not know who it was, because Jesus had disappeared, there being a crowd in the place.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005014,'After these things Jesus found him in the temple and said to him: “See, you are well. Don''t sin any more, so that something worse doesn''t happen to you.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005015,'The man went off and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005016,'So because of this the Jews began persecuting Jesus and trying to kill Him, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005017,'But Jesus answered them, “Until now, my Father works, I also work.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005018,'So because of this they wanted to kill Him all the more, because He was not only breaking the Sabbath but was even saying that God was His own Father, making Himself equal with God!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005019,'Then Jesus answered and said to them: “Most assuredly I say to you, the Son is not able to do anything from Himself, except something He sees the Father doing; because whatever things He does, precisely these the Son also does.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005026,'Because just as the Father has life in Himself, just so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005027,'furthermore He gave Him the authority to pass judgment, because He is Son of Man.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005028,'Do not marvel at this, because a time is coming in which all those in the graves will hear His voice'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005030,'I am not able to do anything from myself. As I hear, I judge, and my judging is just, because I do not seek my own will but the will of the Father who sent me.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005036,'But I have a greater testimony than John''s, because the works that the Father gave me to complete—the very works that I am doing—they testify about me that the Father has sent me.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005039,'You examine the Scriptures because in them you think you have eternal life, yet they are the very ones that testify about me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005040,'But you are not willing to come to me so that you may have life.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005041,'“I do not accept glory from people.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343005047,'But since you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my sayings?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006001,'After these things Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee, or Tiberias.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006002,'And a huge crowd was following Him because they had seen His signs that He kept performing on the sick.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006003,'So Jesus went up on the mountain and sat down there with His disciples.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006004,'(Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006005,'Then, raising His eyes and observing that a huge crowd was coming toward Him, Jesus says to Philip, “Where shall we buy bread so that these folks may eat?”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006007,'Philip answered Him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread would not be enough for them, so that each of them could receive a little.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006008,'One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter''s brother, says to Him,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006010,'Then Jesus said, “Make the people recline.” Now there was plenty of grass in the place; so the men reclined, about five thousand in number.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006011,'Then Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks He distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were reclining; so too with the fish, as much as they wanted.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006012,'So when they were full He says to His disciples, “Collect the leftover fragments so that nothing be wasted.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006013,'So they collected and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves that were left over from those who had eaten.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006014,'Now then, having seen the miraculous sign that Jesus performed the men said, “This One really is the Prophet who is to come into the world.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006015,'So Jesus, perceiving that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him king, withdrew up the mountain again by Himself, alone.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006016,'Now as evening came on His disciples had gone down to the sea,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006017,'and getting into the boat they started to go across the sea toward Capernaum. Well it had been dark for a while and Jesus had not come to them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006018,'Further, the sea was being agitated by a strong wind blowing.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006019,'Then, after they had rowed some three or four miles, they see Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat; and they were afraid.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006020,'But He said to them, “It is I; don''t be afraid!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006021,'Then they wanted to receive Him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006022,'The next day the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea, having seen that there was no other boat there except the one into which His disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not gotten into the boat with His disciples but only His disciples had gone away—'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006024,'so when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum, looking for Jesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006025,'When they found Him on another side of the sea they said to Him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006026,'Jesus answered them and said: “Most assuredly I say to you, you are not seeking me because you saw miraculous signs, but because you ate the bread and were filled.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006027,'Do not work for the food that wastes away but for the food that endures into life eternal, which the Son of the Man will give you; because on Him God the Father has set His seal.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006031,'Our fathers ate the manna in the desert, just as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from Heaven to eat.’ ”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006032,'Then Jesus said to them: “Most assuredly I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread from Heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from Heaven.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006033,'For the bread of God is the One coming down out of Heaven and giving Life to the world.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006034,'Then they said to Him, “Lord, give us this bread always.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006035,'So Jesus said to them: “I am the bread of the Life. Whoever comes to me will never hunger, and whoever believes into me will never thirst.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006038,'because it is not to do my own will that I have come down out of Heaven, but the will of the One who sent me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006039,'Now this is the will of the Father who sent me, that I should lose nothing out of all that He has given me, but should raise it up at the last day.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006040,'Again this is the will of Him who sent me, that everyone who ‘sees’ the Son and believes into Him may have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006041,'Then the Jews started complaining about Him, because He said, “I am the bread that came down out of Heaven.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006042,'And they were saying: “Isn''t this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? So how can he say, ‘I have come down out of Heaven’?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006043,'So Jesus answered and said to them: “Stop complaining among yourselves.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006044,'No one is able to come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006045,'It is written in the prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Therefore everyone who listens and learns from the Father comes to me.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006052,'At that the Jews started quarrelling among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006053,'So Jesus said to them: “Most assuredly I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of the Man and drink His blood, you do not have Life within yourselves.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006065,'And He said, “That is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him by my Father.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006066,'From that time many of His disciples turned back and stopped going around with Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006067,'So Jesus said to the twelve, “You don''t want to go away too, do you?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343006068,'So Simon Peter answered Him: “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343007005,'For not even His brothers were believing into Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,343007006,'So Jesus says to them: “My time is not here yet, but your time is always available.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004003,'And they laid hands on them and put them in custody until the next day, because it was already evening.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004004,'(However, many of those who heard the message believed; the number of the men came to be about five thousand.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004005,'So the next day an assembly of their rulers, both elders and scribes, occurred in Jerusalem,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004006,'along with Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, John and Alexander, and as many as were of high-priestly descent.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004007,'And having placed them in the middle of the assembly they started questioning: “By what power, or by what name did you do this?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004008,'Then Peter, full of Holy Spirit, said to them: “Rulers of the people and elders of Israel:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004009,'If we are being examined today about a good deed done to a helpless man, by what means he has been made well,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004010,'be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Natsorean, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by Him this man stands here before you whole.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004011,'This is ‘the stone which was despised by you, the builders, which has become the chief cornerstone.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004012,'Also, the salvation does not exist in anyone else, because there is no other name under heaven, given among men, by which we must be saved.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004013,'Now upon observing the boldness of Peter and John and perceiving that they were uneducated and unskilled men, they marveled; and they recognized that they had been with Jesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004014,'Further, seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004015,'So ordering them to go out from the council they began to confer among themselves,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004016,'saying: “What can we do to these men? Because, indeed, that a notable miracle has been done through them is evident to all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004017,'But so that it spreads no further among the people, let us severely threaten them to no longer speak to anyone in this name.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004018,'So summoning them they commanded them absolutely not to speak or teach in the name of ‘Jesus’.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004019,'But in answer Peter and John said to them: “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004020,'because we cannot help but speak the things we have seen and heard.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004021,'So threatening them some more they released them, not finding any way to punish them, because of the people, since they were all glorifying God over what had happened;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004022,'because the man on whom this miracle of healing had been performed was over forty years old.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004023,'So upon being released they went to their own group and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004024,'Well upon hearing it, with one mind they called out to God and said: “O Sovereign! You are God, the Maker of sky and earth and ocean, and all that is in them;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004025,'You who said through the mouth of Your servant David: ‘Why did nations snort and peoples plot vain things?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004026,'The kings of the earth took a stand, and the rulers were gathered together, against the Lord and against His Messiah.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004027,'Well, in fact, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, together with Gentiles and peoples of Israel, were gathered together against Your holy Servant Jesus, whom You anointed,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004028,'to do whatever Your hand and Your counsel foreordained to happen.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004029,'As for the present, Lord, consider their threats, and grant to Your slaves to speak Your word with all boldness,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004030,'while You stretch out Your hand to heal and that signs and wonders may occur through the name of Your holy Servant Jesus.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004031,'Well when they had prayed, the place where they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with Holy Spirit and spoke the Word of God with boldness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004032,'Now the multitude of those who believed was of one heart and soul; indeed not one was saying that any of his belongings was his own, but they had all things in common.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004033,'(Also the Apostles were giving witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with great power.) Yes, great grace was on them all,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004034,'because there were not any needy among them—as many as were owners of lands or houses were selling them and bringing the proceeds of the sold items'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004035,'and placing them at the Apostles'' feet, and they were distributed to each according as anyone had need.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004036,'So Joses, who was named Barnabas by the Apostles (which is, being translated, ‘Son of encouragement’), a Levite of the country of Cyprus,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344004037,'having a field, sold it, brought the money and placed it at the Apostles'' feet.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005001,'Now a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005002,'and kept back part of the price for himself, his wife also being party to it; bringing a certain part he placed it at the Apostles'' feet.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005003,'So Peter said: “Ananias, on what basis has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the price of the land?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005004,'While it remained unsold was it not yours, and once sold was it not in your power? How is it that you have conceived this thing in your heart? You did not lie to men but to God.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005005,'Well upon hearing these words Ananias fell down and expired! (Great fear came on all who heard these things.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005006,'So the young men got up and wrapped him, and carrying him out they buried him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005007,'Now after an interval of some three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005008,'So Peter addressed her, “Tell me whether you sold the land for so much.” So she said, “Yes, for so much.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005009,'Peter said to her: “How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of those who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005010,'So she immediately fell down at his feet and expired! So upon entering the young men found her dead, and carrying her out they buried her beside her husband.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005011,'So great fear came on the whole assembly and on all who heard these things.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005012,'Now many signs and wonders were being performed among the people by the hands of the Apostles; and they were all in Solomon''s Porch with one purpose.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005013,'None of the rest dared to join them, but the people were magnifying them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005014,'Believers were increasingly added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005015,'to the point that they kept carrying the sick into the streets, placing them on cots and pallets, so that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005016,'Further, the multitude from the surrounding cities also kept coming into Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those who were tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all healed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005017,'Then the high priest rose up, and all those with him (being the sect of the Sadducees); they were filled with jealousy'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005018,'and laid their hands on the Apostles and put them in the common prison.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005019,'But, during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison, and leading them out he said,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005020,'“Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005021,'So upon hearing it they entered the temple about daybreak and started to teach. Then the high priest and those with him arrived and convened the Sanhedrin, even all the council of elders of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005022,'Well, upon arriving the operatives did not find them in the jail, so they returned and reported,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005023,'saying: “We certainly found the prison securely locked, and the guards standing in front of the doors, but upon opening them we found no one inside!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005024,'Now when the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were really perplexed as to what the implications might be.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005025,'But someone came and told them, “Hey, the men whom you put in the jail are standing in the temple and teaching the people!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005026,'Then the captain went with the operatives and brought them without violence, because they were afraid that the people might stone them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005027,'So bringing them they set them before the Sanhedrin; and the high priest addressed them'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005028,'saying: “Did we not emphatically command you not to teach in this name? Just look, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man''s blood on us!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005029,'So in answer Peter and the Apostles said: “One must obey God rather than men.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005030,'The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you murdered by hanging on a tree.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005031,'Him God has exalted to His right hand as Prince and Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005032,'And we are witnesses to these statements about Him, as also is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those obeying Him.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005033,'Well upon hearing it they became infuriated and started plotting to kill them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005034,'But someone in the council stood up (a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law respected by all the people) and commanded to put the Apostles out for a bit.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005035,'He then said to them: “Men, Israelites, take heed to yourselves concerning these men, as to what you are about to do.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005036,'For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody; with whom about four hundred men joined up; who was killed, and all who obeyed him were scattered and came to nothing.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005037,'Later Judas the Galilean rose up, in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him. He also perished, and all who obeyed him were dispersed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005038,'So now I say to you, keep away from these men and leave them alone; because if this counsel or this work should be of men, it will be abolished;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005039,'but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow it—lest you even be found to be fighting against God!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005040,'Well they were persuaded by him, and summoned the Apostles; after beating them they commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005041,'So they went out rejoicing from the presence of the council, in that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name of the Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344005042,'And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not stop teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344006001,'Now in those days, as the disciples were multiplying, a complaint arose from the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344006002,'So summoning the multitude of the disciples the twelve said: “It is not advantageous that we should forsake the Word of God to serve at tables.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344006003,'Therefore, brothers, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we will appoint over this need.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344006004,'But we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the Word.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344006005,'The statement pleased the whole multitude; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicholas, a proselyte from Antioch,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344006006,'whom they set before the Apostles; and after praying they laid hands on them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344006007,'Well the Word of God kept spreading, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem kept multiplying at a great rate, and a large company of the priests were obeying the faith.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344006008,'While Stephen, full of faith and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344006009,'Then there arose some from what is called the Synagogue of the Freedmen (Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia), disputing with Stephen.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344006010,'And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344006011,'Then they instigated men to say, “We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344006012,'And they stirred up the people, and the elders and the scribes; and coming upon him they seized him, and brought him in to the Sanhedrin;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344006013,'and they put forward false witnesses who said: “This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against the holy place and the law;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344006014,'for we have heard him saying that this Jesus the Natsorean will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses delivered to us.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344006015,'All who sat in the council, looking intently at him, saw his face like the face of an angel.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007001,'Then the high priest said, “Can these things be so?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007002,'So he said: “Men, brothers and fathers, listen: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he resided in Haran,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007003,'and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into a land that I will show you.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007004,'Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and resided in Haran. From there, after his father died, God moved him to this land in which you now live;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007005,'yet He did not give him an inheritance in it, not even a footstep. He promised to give it to him for a possession, that is, to his seed after him, though he had no child.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007006,'Further, God spoke like this: that his offspring would be aliens in a foreign land—and that they would be enslaved and oppressed—four hundred years.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007007,'‘I will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage,’ said God, ‘and after that they will come out and serve Me in this place.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007008,'And He gave him a covenant of circumcision; and so he begot Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac did the same to Jacob, and Jacob to the twelve patriarchs.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007009,'“The patriarchs, being envious, sold Joseph into Egypt; yet God was with him'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007010,'and delivered him out of all his adversities, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007011,'And a famine came upon all the land of Egypt and Canaan, even a great affliction, and our fathers could not find food.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007012,'But upon hearing that there was wheat in Egypt, Jacob first sent our fathers.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007013,'On the second trip Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph''s family was presented to Pharaoh.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007014,'Joseph sent and summoned his father Jacob and all his relatives, seventy-five souls.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007015,'So Jacob went down to Egypt; and he died, he and our fathers;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007016,'and they were transferred to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor of Shechem.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007017,'“Now as the time of the promise was approaching which God had sworn to Abraham, the people increased and were multiplied in Egypt,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007019,'This man took advantage of our race and oppressed our fathers, making them expose their babies so that they would not stay alive.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007020,'At that time Moses was born, and was well pleasing to God; he was nurtured in his father''s house for three months.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007021,'When he was exposed, Pharaoh''s daughter took him to herself and brought him up as her own son.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007022,'So Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; he was mighty in words and deeds.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007023,'Now when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the sons of Israel.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007024,'Well seeing one of them being wronged, he defended and avenged the one being oppressed, striking down the Egyptian.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007025,'Now he supposed that his brothers understood that God was giving them deliverance by his hand, but they did not understand.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007026,'The next day he appeared to them as they were fighting and tried to reconcile them, saying, ‘Men, you are brothers; why do you wrong one another?’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007027,'But the one who was wronging his neighbor pushed Moses away, saying: ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007028,'Do you want to kill me as you did the Egyptian yesterday?’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007029,'Well Moses fled at that word, and became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he begot two sons.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007030,'“And when another forty years had passed, Angel of the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007041,'Well they made a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and started rejoicing in the works of their hands.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344007042,'But God turned away and gave them over to serve the army of the heaven, just as it is written in Book of the Prophets: ‘House of Israel, did you offer me slaughtered animals and sacrifices during forty years in the wilderness?'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008018,'Well, upon observing that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the Apostles'' hands, Simon offered them money'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008019,'saying, “Give this power to me also, that anyone on whom I lay hands may receive Holy Spirit.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008020,'But Peter said to him: “May your silver go with you into perdition, for thinking that the gift of God could be acquired with money!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008021,'You have neither part nor portion in this matter, because your heart is not right before God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008022,'Turn away therefore from this your wickedness and make petition to God, in case the intent of your heart may be forgiven you;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008023,'for I see you being into a gall of bitterness and a fetter of unrighteousness.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008024,'So in answer Simon said, “You make petition to the Lord on my behalf, so that nothing of what you have spoken may come upon me!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008025,'So when they had both thoroughly testified and spoken the Word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem; they also evangelized many Samaritan villages.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008026,'Then an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip saying, “Get up and go south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza; it is desolate.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008027,'So he got up and went; and there, a man, an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a court-official of Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasury, who had come worshiping to Jerusalem'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008028,'—he was returning, sitting in his chariot and reading aloud the prophet Isaiah.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008029,'And the Spirit said to Philip, “Go forward and join this chariot.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008030,'So running up Philip heard him reading the prophet Isaiah and said, “Do you really understand what you are reading?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008031,'So he said, “Well how can I, unless someone guides me?” And he urged Philip to come up and sit with him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008032,'Now the portion of the Scripture that he was reading was this: “He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, so He does not open His mouth.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008033,'In His humiliation His justice was removed, and who will recount His generation? Because His life is removed from the earth.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008034,'So continuing the eunuch said to Philip, “I ask you, about whom does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008035,'So opening his mouth and beginning from this Scripture, Philip preached Jesus to him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008036,'Now as they were going down the road they came upon some water, and the eunuch said: “Look, water! What is keeping me from being baptized?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008038,'So he ordered the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008039,'Now when they came up out of the water, Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him any more, because he went on his way rejoicing.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344008040,'Philip was found at Azotus, and as he passed through he evangelized all the towns until he came to Caesarea.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009001,'Meanwhile Saul, still exhaling murderous threats against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009002,'and asked for letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, so that if he should find any who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009003,'So it happened, as he was going, that he got close to Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven shone around him;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009004,'and falling to the ground he heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009005,'So he said, “Who are you, Lord?” So the Lord said, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009007,'The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the sound but seeing no one.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009008,'Then Saul got up from the ground, and upon opening his eyes he saw no one; so leading him by the hand they brought him into Damascus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009009,'He was without sight for three days, and neither ate nor drank.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009010,'Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision, “Ananias!” So he said, “Here I am, Lord.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009011,'So the Lord said to him: “Get up and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas inquire by name for Saul of Tarsus; because, you see, he is praying,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009012,'and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and placing a hand on him, so that he might recover his sight.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009013,'But Ananias answered: “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how many evil things he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009014,'Moreover here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who are calling on Your name.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009015,'But the Lord said to him: “Get moving, because this man is a chosen vessel to me, to carry my name before nations and kings, also the children of Israel;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009016,'for I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name''s sake.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009017,'So Ananias went and entered the house, and placing his hands on him he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me so that you may recover your sight and be filled by Holy Spirit.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009018,'Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he recovered his sight forthwith; and getting up he was baptized,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009019,'and upon receiving food he was strengthened. So Saul was with the disciples in Damascus for a number of days.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009020,'Immediately he started proclaiming Jesus in the synagogues, that He is the Son of the God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009021,'Well, all who heard him were astounded and started saying: “Isn''t this the one who tried to destroy, in Jerusalem, those who called on this name? Even here he had come with that purpose, that he might take them bound to the high priests.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009022,'But Saul kept growing stronger and kept on confounding the Jews who lived in Damascus, proving that ‘This One is the Christ.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009023,'Now when a good many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009024,'but their plot became known to Saul. They started watching the gates day and night, so that they might kill him;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009025,'so the disciples took him by night and passed him through the wall, lowering him in a hamper.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009026,'Now upon arriving in Jerusalem Saul kept trying to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009027,'But Barnabas took him in tow and brought him to the apostles, and described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken fearlessly in the name of the Lord Jesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009028,'So he was with them in Jerusalem, going in and out, and speaking fearlessly in the name of Jesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009029,'He kept on speaking and debating with the Hellenists, so they started trying to kill him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009030,'Upon finding it out, the brothers brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009031,'So then the congregations throughout all Judea and Galilee, and Samaria, had peace and were built up; and proceeding in the fear of the Lord and in the enabling of the Holy Spirit they were being multiplied.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009032,'Now it happened, as Peter went through all those parts, that he also went down to the saints who were living in Lydda.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009033,'And there he found a certain man named Aeneas who was paralyzed—he had been lying on a pallet for eight years.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009034,'Peter said to him: “Aeneas, Jesus the Messiah is healing you. Get up and make your bed!” And immediately he stood up!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009035,'All who were living in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009036,'Now there was a certain disciple in Joppa named Tabitha, which is translated Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and charitable deeds that she kept doing.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009037,'But it happened in those days that she took sick and died; so when they had washed her they placed her in the upper room.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009038,'Now Lydda was near Joppa; the disciples, having heard that Peter was there, sent to him imploring him not to delay in coming to them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009039,'So Peter got up and went with them; upon arriving they took him up to the upper room; all the widows stood around him weeping and showing the coats and garments that Dorcas was making while she was with them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009040,'So Peter put them all out, kneeled down and prayed. Turning to the body he said, “Tabitha, get up!” So she opened her eyes, and upon seeing Peter she sat up.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009041,'Then he gave her a hand and lifted her up, and calling the saints and widows he presented her alive.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009042,'And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344009043,'So it was that he stayed many days in Joppa with a certain Simon, a tanner.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010001,'Now there was a certain man in Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010002,'devout and fearing God with all his household, both giving alms generously to the people and praying to God about everything.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010003,'About the ninth hour of the day, in a vision, he saw clearly an angel of God entering his presence and saying to him, “Cornelius!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010004,'Well, staring at him and being frightened he said, “What is it, Lord?” So he said to him: “Your prayers and your alms have come up for a memorial before God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010005,'Now send men to Joppa and summon Simon, who is surnamed Peter;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010006,'he is lodging with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010007,'So when the angel who spoke to him had departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier from among those who were faithful to him,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010008,'and explaining everything to them he sent them to Joppa.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010009,'Now on the next day, as they were traveling and drawing near to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray at about noon.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010010,'Well he became hungry and wanted to eat; but while they were preparing, a trance fell on him,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010011,'and he saw the heaven opened and a container like a great sheet descending to him—it was tied at the four corners and was being let down to the earth—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010012,'in which were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth (both wild animals and reptiles) and birds of the sky.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010013,'Then a voice came to him, “Get up, Peter, slaughter and eat!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010014,'But Peter said: “No way, Lord! Never have I eaten anything ‘common’ or unclean!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010015,'So the voice came to him a second time, “What (pl) God has made clean you must not call ‘common’!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010016,'Well this happened three times, and then the object was taken back up into the sky.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010017,'Now as Peter was really perplexed within himself as to what the vision that he had seen might mean, well the men who had been sent by Cornelius, having inquired and found Simon''s house, stood before the gate,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010018,'and calling out they inquired whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, was staying there as a guest.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010019,'So as Peter was pondering the vision the Spirit said to him: “Listen, some men are looking for you;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010020,'so get up and go downstairs; and go with them, doubting nothing, for I have sent them.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010021,'So going down to the men Peter said: “Yes, I am the one you are looking for. For what reason have you come?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010022,'So they said: “Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man, well spoken of by all the nation of the Jews, was divinely instructed by an angel to summon you to his house, and to hear words from you.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010023,'So he invited them in and put them up. The next day Peter set out with them, also some of the brothers from Joppa went with him;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010024,'and the following day they entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relatives and close friends.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010025,'So when Peter actually arrived, Cornelius met him, fell at his feet and worshiped.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010026,'But Peter lifted him up, saying: “Stand up! I myself am also a man.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010027,'And conversing with him he went in and found many gathered there.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010028,'Then he said to them: “You know how it is unlawful for a Jewish man to associate with or to approach a different race; but God has shown me that I should not call any man ‘common’ or unclean.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010029,'Therefore also I came without objection as soon as I was sent for. So I ask, for what reason did you send for me?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010030,'So Cornelius said: “I have been fasting during four days until this very hour; yes, it was the ninth hour, I was praying in my house when wow, a man stood before me in shining clothing'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010031,'and said: ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms are remembered before God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010032,'Send therefore to Joppa and summon Simon, who is surnamed Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea; upon arriving he will speak to you.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010033,'So I sent to you at once, and you did well to come. Now then, we are all present before God to hear all the things commanded you by God.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010034,'So opening his mouth Peter said: “Really, I comprehend that God is not One to show partiality,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010035,'but in every ethnic nation whoever fears Him and works righteousness is acceptable to Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010036,'The word that He sent to the sons of Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ—He is Lord of all—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010037,'that spoken word you know, that was proclaimed throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism that John preached:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010038,'Jesus of Natsareth, how God anointed Him with Holy Spirit and power, who went about doing good and healing all those being oppressed by the devil, because God was with Him'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010039,'—yes, we are witnesses of all that He did, both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem—whom they also killed, hanging Him on a tree.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010040,'Him God raised on the third day, and gave Him to become visible,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010041,'not to all the people but to witnesses who had been chosen beforehand by God, to us, who ate and drank with Him after He arose out from the dead.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010042,'And He ordered us to proclaim to the people, that is, to testify that He is the One who has been ordained by God as Judge of living and dead.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010043,'To Him all the prophets bear witness that through His name everyone who believes into Him will receive forgiveness of sins.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010044,'While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who were hearing the message.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010045,'Well the believers of the circumcision Jews who had come with Peter were astonished, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had also been poured out on the Gentiles,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010046,'in that they heard them speaking languages and magnifying God. Then Peter responded:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010047,'“Surely no one can forbid the water, can he, that these should not be baptized who received the Holy Spirit just like we did?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344010048,'So he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they asked him to stay a few days.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011001,'Now the Apostles and the brothers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011002,'When Peter went up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision party started contending with him,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011003,'saying, “You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011004,'So Peter began by explaining it to them in order, saying:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011005,'“I was in the town of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision: a certain object like a great sheet coming down out of the sky, being lowered by its four corners; and it came to me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011006,'Upon peering into it I observed and distinguished the quadrupeds of the earth—both the wild animals and the reptiles—and the birds of the sky.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011007,'Then I heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter, slaughter and eat!’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011008,'So I said: ‘No way, Lord! Never has anything ‘common’ or unclean entered my mouth!’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011009,'But the voice answered me, a second time, from heaven, ‘Things that God has made clean you must not call ‘common’.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011010,'Well this was done three times, and it was all pulled back up into the sky.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011011,'At that very moment three men stopped in front of the house where I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011012,'The Spirit told me to go with them, doubting nothing. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man''s house.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011013,'He then related to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying to him, ‘Send to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011014,'who will speak words to you by which you and all your household will be saved.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011015,'Well as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as on us at the beginning.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011016,'I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, ‘John indeed baptized with water, but you will be baptized with Holy Spirit.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011017,'So if God gave them the same gift as He gave us when we believed upon the Lord Jesus, who was I to be able to withstand God?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011018,'Upon hearing these things they acquiesced and started glorifying God, saying, “So then, God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance into life!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011019,'Now those who had been scattered by the persecution that came about in connection with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews only.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011020,'But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who upon entering Antioch started speaking to the Greek-speakers, preaching the good news of the Lord Jesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011021,'And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011022,'Well the report concerning them reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011023,'Upon arriving and seeing the grace of God, he was glad, and he kept encouraging them all to remain true to the Lord with purpose of heart'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011024,'(for he was a good man, full of Holy Spirit and of faith). And a considerable crowd was added to the Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011025,'Then Barnabas departed for Tarsus to look for Saul,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011026,'and upon finding him he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for a whole year they met with the congregation and taught a great many people. The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011027,'Now in these days, prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011028,'One of them, named Agabus, stood up and indicated by the Spirit that a great famine was about to come upon the whole world (this indeed happened while Claudius was Caesar).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011029,'Then the disciples, to the extent that any had plenty, each of them determined to send relief to the brothers who lived in Judea;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344011030,'which they also did, sending it to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012001,'Now about that time, Herod the king laid hands on some from the church to mistreat them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012002,'James, the brother of John, he put to death by sword.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012003,'When he saw that it was pleasing to the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter as well (it was during the days of the unleavened loaves)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012004,'—upon seizing him he put him in prison, turning him over to sixteen soldiers to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012005,'Well Peter was being held in the prison all right, but the congregation was making earnest prayer to God on his behalf.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012006,'So when Herod was about to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, with guards protecting the prison in front of the doors.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012007,'Suddenly, an angel of the Lord was there, and a light shone in the cell; striking Peter on the side he roused him saying, “Quick, get up!” and the chains fell away from his wrists.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012008,'Then the angel said to him, “Fasten your belt and put on your sandals.” So he did. Then he said to him, “Put on your cloak and follow me.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012009,'So he went out and started following him, not realizing that what the angel was doing was real; he supposed he was seeing a vision.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012010,'Passing through the first and second guard posts, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, that opened for them by itself; upon exiting they advanced one block, and suddenly the angel left him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012011,'When Peter had come to himself he said, “Now I know for certain that the Lord sent His angel and delivered me out of Herod''s hand and from all the expectation of the Jewish people.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012012,'Upon reflection he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John (the one called Mark), where a considerable number had gathered and were praying.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012013,'When Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012014,'Upon recognizing Peter''s voice, she was so glad she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing before the gate!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012015,'But they said to her, “You''re crazy!” but she kept insisting that it was so. So they said, “It is his angel.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012016,'But Peter kept on knocking; so when they opened the door and saw him, they were astounded.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012017,'Motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he related to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. Then he said, “Tell these things to James and the brothers.” And going out he went off to a different place.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012018,'Now as soon as it was day, there was no small commotion among the soldiers about what had become of Peter!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012019,'Well after searching for him and not finding him, Herod examined the guards and ordered that they be executed. Going down from Judea to Caesarea, he stayed there.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012020,'Now Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; so they came with one accord to him, and having won over Blastus, the king''s chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country was supplied with food from the king''s.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012021,'So on an appointed day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat on the throne and started to deliver an address to them.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012023,'Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him down, because he did not give glory to God, and being eaten by worms, he died.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012024,'And the Word of God kept growing and multiplying.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344012025,'Now Barnabas and Saul returned to Antioch, having fulfilled their mission, also taking with them John, the one called Mark.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013001,'Now in the congregation that was in Antioch there were certain prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon (the one called Niger), Lucius the Cyrenian, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch), and Saul.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013002,'As they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart to me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013003,'Then, having fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them off.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013007,'who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, really wanting to hear the Word of God.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013011,'Well now, the Lord''s hand is against you and you will be blind, not seeing the sun until next season!” Immediately mist and darkness engulfed him, and he started going around looking for someone to lead him by the hand.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013012,'Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had happened, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013013,'Then Paul and his party set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphilia (here John left them and returned to Jerusalem).'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013018,'For a period of about forty years He put up with them in the wilderness.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013020,'After these things, He gave judges for about four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013021,'And then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul, a son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013022,'And removing him He raised up for them David as king, about whom He gave witness and said, ‘I have found David son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will.’'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013035,'Further, it is stated elsewhere, ‘You will not allow your Holy One to see decay.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013036,'Now David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell asleep, was buried with his fathers, and saw decay;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013042,'Now as the Jews were going out of the synagogue, the Gentiles implored repeatedly that these words might be spoken to them the next Sabbath.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013044,'Well the next Sabbath almost the whole city was gathered to hear the Word of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013045,'But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with envy and started speaking against the things said by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013046,'But Paul and Barnabas speaking boldly said: “It was necessary that God''s Word should be spoken to you first. But since you reject it, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, now we are being turned to the Gentiles.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013048,'Now upon hearing this, the Gentiles rejoiced and glorified the Word of the Lord; and as many as had been appointed to eternal live believed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013049,'Well the Word of the Lord was being spread throughout all the region.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013050,'But the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city, and raised up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their borders.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344013052,'But the disciples were filled with joy and with Holy Spirit.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014001,'Now it happened in Iconium that they went together into the synagogue of the Jews, and they spoke to such effect that a large number of both Jews and Greeks believed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014002,'But the disobedient Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014003,'Even so they stayed there a considerable time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who was bearing witness to the word of His grace, giving signs and wonders to take place by their hands.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014004,'Well the population of the city became divided; some sided with the Jews, others with the apostles.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014005,'But when a plot was hatched by both Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to mistreat and stone them,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014006,'they became aware of it and escaped to the cities of Lycaonia—Lystra, Derbe and the surrounding area—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014007,'where they continued to preach the Gospel.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014008,'Well in Lystra a certain man with helpless feet was sitting (lame from his mother''s womb, who had never walked).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014009,'This man was listening to Paul speaking; who looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be healed,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014010,'said with a loud voice, “Stand up straight on your feet!” And the man jumped up and began to walk!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014011,'Now when the crowd saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in Lycaonian, “The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014012,'And Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014013,'Then the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of their city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates, intending to make a sacrifice, along with the crowd.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014014,'But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothes and rushed into the crowd, crying out'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014015,'and saying: “Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men with the same nature as you, giving you good news, telling you to turn from these useless things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014016,'who in the former generations allowed all the ethnic nations to walk in their own ways.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014017,'Nevertheless He did not leave Himself without witness, doing good, giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014018,'Even saying these things, they barely stopped the crowd from sacrificing to them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014019,'Then Jews from Antioch and Iconium came, and having persuaded the crowd and having stoned Paul, they dragged him out of the city, supposing him to have died.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014020,'But as the disciples stood around him, he got up and entered the city. The next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014021,'When they had evangelized that city and discipled a good number, they returned to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014022,'strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying, “We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014023,'When they had appointed elders for them in every congregation, having prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord into whom they had believed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014024,'After going through Pisidia, they came to Pamphilia.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014025,'When they had declared the Word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014026,'From there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had completed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014027,'So upon arriving and gathering the congregation, they reported all that God had done with them, and that He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344014028,'And they stayed there a long time with the disciples.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015001,'Then some men came down from Judea and started teaching the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015002,'Well this provoked serious dissension and argument between Paul and Barnabas and them, so Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with certain others of them, to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015003,'So being sent on their way by the congregation, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, describing the conversion of the Gentiles; and they caused great joy to all the brothers.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015004,'Upon arriving in Jerusalem, they were received by the congregation and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all that God had done with them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015005,'But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, “It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the Law of Moses.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015006,'So the apostles and the elders came together to consider this matter.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015007,'When there had been plenty of discussion, Peter got up and said to them: “Men, brothers, you know that a good while ago God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the message of the Gospel and believe.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015008,'And the heart-knowing God acknowledged them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He did to us;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015009,'and He made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015010,'Now therefore, why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015011,'Rather, we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same manner as they.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015012,'Then the whole assembly kept silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul reporting what signs and wonders God had done among the ethnic nations through them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015013,'Now when they finished, James reacted saying: “Men, brothers, listen to me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015014,'Simeon has described how God first intervened to extract from the Gentiles a people for His name.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015015,'And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015016,'‘After these things I will return, and I will rebuild David''s tent, the fallen one; yes, I will rebuild its ruins and restore it;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015017,'so that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles—the ones, that is, upon whom my name has been called—says the Lord who does all these things.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015018,'All His works are known to God from eternity.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015019,'Therefore I judge that we should not create difficulty for those who are turning to God from among the ethnic nations,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015020,'but that we write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, from fornication, from what is strangled, and from blood.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015021,'For from ancient generations Moses has in every city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015022,'Then it pleased the apostles and the elders, with the whole congregation, to send chosen men from among them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Judas (the one called Barsabas) and Silas, leading men among the brothers.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015023,'They wrote by their hand the following: “The apostles and the elders and the brothers, to the Gentile brothers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: Greetings.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015024,'Since we have heard that some who went out from among us have disturbed you with words, unsettling your souls, saying that you must be circumcised and keep the Law—to whom we gave no such authorization—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015025,'it seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose men to send to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015026,'men who have risked their lives for the sake of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015027,'So we have sent Judas and Silas, who will also confirm these things by word of mouth.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015028,'It seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to place no greater burden upon you than these necessary things:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015029,'to abstain from things offered to idols, from ‘blood’, from anything strangled and from fornication; it will be in your own best interest to keep away from these things. Farewell.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015030,'So when they were sent off they came to Antioch, and gathering the crowd they delivered the letter.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015031,'When they had read it, they rejoiced over the encouragement.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015032,'Both Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015033,'After some time, they were released with peace from the brothers to the apostles.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015035,'But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the Word of the Lord, with many others also.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015036,'Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us return now and visit our brothers in each city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, to see how they are doing.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015037,'Now Barnabas resolved to take John (the one called Mark) along as well.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015038,'But Paul insisted on not taking someone who had deserted them in Pamphilia and not gone with them to the work.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015039,'Well the contention became so sharp that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015040,'while Paul chose Silas and set out, having been commended by the brothers to the grace of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344015041,'He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the congregations.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016001,'So he came to Derbe and Lystra. Well now, a certain disciple was there named Timothy, son of a certain Jewish woman who believed, but his father was a Greek;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016002,'he was well spoken of by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016003,'Paul wanted to have him go on with him, so he took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts, because they all knew that his father was a Greek.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016004,'As they were going through the cities they were delivering the dogmas to them, to keep—the ones that had been determined by the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016005,'So the congregations kept on being strengthened in the faith, and were increasing in number daily.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016006,'Now when they had gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016007,'they approached Mysia and tried to go to Bithynia, but the Spirit did not permit them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016008,'So they bypassed Mysia and went down to Troas.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016009,'A vision appeared to Paul during the night: a man of Macedonia was standing, appealing to him and saying, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016010,'So when he saw the vision, we immediately prepared to go over to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to evangelize them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016011,'So setting sail from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and the next day to Neapolis;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016012,'and from there to Philippi, which is the foremost city of that part of Macedonia, a colony. We stayed some days in that city.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016013,'On the Sabbath day we went outside the city by a river, where prayer was customarily made, and sitting down we started speaking to the assembled women.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016014,'A certain woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God, really listened, whose heart the Lord opened to give heed to the things spoken by Paul.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016015,'When she and her household were baptized, she appealed saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay.” So she persuaded us.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016016,'Now it happened, as we were going to prayer, that a certain slave girl having a spirit of divination met us, who brought considerable profit to her owners by divination.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016017,'Following Paul and Silas this girl kept calling out, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to us the way of salvation!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016018,'She kept this up for many days! So Paul, becoming increasingly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!” And it came out that very hour.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016019,'But when her owners saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the market place to the rulers,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016020,'and bringing them before the magistrates they said, “These men, being Jews, are agitating our city,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016021,'and are advocating customs that are not lawful for us, being Romans, to receive or do.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016022,'The crowd joined in the attack against them, and the magistrates tore the clothes off of them and ordered a beating with rods.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016023,'When they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them securely;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016025,'Well about midnight Paul and Silas were singing hymns to God in prayer; and the other prisoners were listening to them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016026,'Suddenly there was a great earthquake, enough to shake the foundations of the prison; immediately all the doors were opened and everyone''s chains were loosed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016027,'But the jailer, awaking from sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew sword, intending to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016028,'But Paul shouted out, “Don''t harm yourself, because we are all here!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016029,'So calling for a light he ran in and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016030,'He then brought them out and said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016031,'So they said, “Believe upon the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved, you and your household.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016032,'Then they spoke the Word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016033,'In that same hour of the night he took them aside and washed their wounds, and thereupon he and all his family were baptized.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016034,'Then he brought them into his house and set a meal before them, and he was really rejoicing, having believed in God with his whole family.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016035,'Now when it was day the magistrates sent the officers saying, “Let those men go.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016036,'So the jailer reported these words to Paul, “The magistrates have sent to release you; so now you can leave and go in peace.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016037,'But Paul said to them: “After severely beating us in public, although we were uncondemned Romans, they threw us into prison, and now do they toss us out on the sly? No way! Rather, let them come themselves and escort us out!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016038,'So the officers reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016039,'and they came and appealed to them, and leading them out they asked them to leave the city.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344016040,'So exiting the prison they entered Lydia''s place, and upon seeing the brothers they encouraged them and departed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017001,'Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017002,'So Paul, as was his custom, went in to them and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017008,'Well they agitated the crowd and the city officials when they heard these things.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017009,'Then they took a security bond from Jason and the rest and let them go.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017010,'Immediately, during the night, the brothers sent both Paul and Silas away to Berea; on arriving they went into the synagogue of the Jews.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017011,'Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all goodwill, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things might be so.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017012,'Therefore many of them believed, and also not a few of the Greeks, prominent women as well as men.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017013,'But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the Word of God was also being proclaimed by Paul in Berea, they came too, agitating the crowds.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017014,'So then, without delay, the brothers sent Paul away, as if to go by sea, while both Silas and Timothy remained there.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017015,'But those who were conducting Paul actually took him all the way to Athens; and receiving a command to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him as quickly as possible, they started back.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017016,'Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was increasingly aroused within him as he observed that the city was full of idols.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017017,'So he reasoned both in the synagogue with the Jews and devout persons, and in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017018,'Then certain philosophers, both Epicureans and Stoics, encountered him. Some said, “What might this idea-scavenger want to say?” Others said, “He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities”—because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017019,'So taking him in tow they led him to the Areopagus and said: “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017020,'Because you are bringing some strange things to our ears, and we would like to know what they might mean.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017021,'(Now all Athenians and resident foreigners spent their time in nothing else but to tell, or else to hear, some novelty.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017022,'So standing in the middle of the Areopagus Paul said: “Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017023,'because as I went along and scrutinized the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO UNKNOWN GOD. Now then, the one you worship as ‘unknown’, this is the One I proclaim to you:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017024,'The God who made the world and everything in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples built by hands,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017025,'neither is He cared for by men''s hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself has always given life and breath to all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017026,'And from one blood He made every ethnic nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017027,'so that they should seek the Lord, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017028,'because in Him we live and move and have our being. As also some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also his offspring.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017029,'Therefore, since we are God''s offspring, we ought not to think that the divinity is like gold or silver or stone—something shaped by human skill and imagination.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017030,'Such times of ignorance God did indeed overlook, but now He commands all people everywhere to repent,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017031,'because He has appointed a day in which He will judge the inhabited world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained; He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017032,'Well when they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some started scoffing, while others said, “We will hear you again about this.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017033,'And with that Paul went out from among them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344017034,'However some men believed and joined him, among them Dionysius the Areopagite, also a woman named Damaris, and others with them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018001,'Now after these things Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018002,'And encountering a certain Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla (because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to depart from Rome), he joined them;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018003,'and because he practiced the same trade, he stayed on with them and worked (their trade was tentmaker).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018004,'Every Sabbath in the synagogue he would reason with both Jews and Greeks, trying to persuade them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018005,'But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the Spirit, solemnly insisting to the Jews: Jesus is the Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018006,'But since they kept contradicting and blaspheming, he shook his clothes and said to them: “Your blood be upon your own heads! I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018007,'So he moved from there into the house of a man named Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018008,'Then Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his household; and as they were hearing, many of the Corinthians were believing and being baptized.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018009,'Now the Lord said to Paul by a vision at night: “Do not be afraid; rather speak and do not keep silent,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018010,'because I am with you and no one will attack you to harm you, because I have many people in this city.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018011,'So he stayed on for a year and six months, teaching the Word of God among them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018012,'Now while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018013,'saying, “This fellow persuades the people to worship God contrary to the law.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018014,'But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews: “If there really was some misdeed or wicked crime, O Jews, there would be reason for me to bear with you;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018015,'but since it is an issue over a word and names and your own law, see to it yourselves; because I refuse to be a judge of such matters.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018016,'And he drove them from the judgment seat.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018017,'Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the judgment seat. But none of this was a delay to Gallio.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018018,'Paul still remained there a good while, then took leave of the brothers and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila (he had shaved his head in Cenchrea, because he had a vow).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018019,'He came to Ephesus and left them there (after having entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018020,'When they asked him to stay a longer time with them, he did not consent;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018021,'rather he took leave of them saying, “I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem; but I will return again to you, God willing.” Then he set sail from Ephesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018022,'When he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up and greeted the church in Jerusalem, he returned to Antioch.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018023,'After spending some time there, he departed and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018024,'Now a certain Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, an eloquent man, mighty in the Scriptures, arrived in Ephesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018025,'This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in the Spirit he was speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018026,'So he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018027,'When he decided to go across into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to receive him; upon arriving he was a great help to those who had believed through the Grace;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344018028,'because he kept refuting the Jews vigorously, publicly, demonstrating Jesus to be the Christ, from the Scriptures.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019001,'Now it happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper country, came to Ephesus. And finding certain disciples'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019002,'he said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” So they said to him, “But we have not so much as heard that there is a Holy Spirit!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019003,'So he said, “Into what then were you baptized?” So they said, “Into John''s baptism.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019004,'So Paul said, “John indeed baptized with a baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe into the One who would come after him, that is, into Jesus, the Christ.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019005,'So upon hearing this they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019006,'And as Paul laid his hands on them the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they started speaking languages and prophesying.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019007,'There were about twelve men in all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019008,'During three months Paul kept going to the synagogue and speaking boldly, reasoning and persuading concerning the things of the Kingdom of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019009,'But when some became hardened and disobedient, maligning the Way before the crowd, he withdrew from them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of a certain Tyrannus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019010,'Now this continued for two years, so that all who lived in Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the Word of the Lord Jesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019011,'Further, God kept working unusual miracles by the hands of Paul,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019012,'so that even handkerchiefs or aprons that he touched were applied to the sick, and the diseases left them and the wicked spirits went out from them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019013,'Well some among the itinerant Jewish exorcists attempted to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had wicked spirits saying, “We adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019014,'In fact there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who were doing this.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019015,'But a particular wicked spirit reacted and said, “Jesus I know, and I am acquainted with Paul, but who are you?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019016,'And the man in whom the wicked spirit was jumped on them and overpowered them; he was so much stronger that they ran out of that house naked and wounded.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019017,'Now this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived in Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was being exalted.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019018,'And many of those who had believed started coming, confessing and disclosing their practices.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019019,'In fact, many of those who had practiced magic brought their books together and burned them up, in front of everybody (they had calculated their value and it totaled fifty thousand pieces of silver).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019020,'With power like that it was that the word of the Lord kept growing and prevailing.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019021,'Now after these things were accomplished, Paul resolved in his spirit to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, “After I have been there, I must also see Rome.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019022,'So he sent two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, on to Macedonia, while he himself stayed on in Asia for a time.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019023,'Now it was during that time that a serious disturbance concerning the Way occurred.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019024,'A certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, habitually brought in plenty of business for the artisans;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019025,'he called them together, along with the workmen in related trades, and said: “Men, you know that our prosperity depends on this trade.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019026,'And you observe and hear that not only in Ephesus but throughout almost all Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that handmade things are not gods.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019027,'So not only is this trade of ours in danger of falling into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be discredited, and even her own majesty be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worship.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019028,'Now upon hearing this they were filled with anger and began shouting, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019029,'So the whole city was filled with confusion, and they rushed into the theater with one accord (they had seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul''s traveling companions).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019030,'When Paul wanted to go in to the people, the disciples would not let him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019031,'Even some of the officials of Asia, being his friends, sent word to him and urged him not to venture into the theater.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019032,'The assembly was in confusion: some were shouting one thing and some another; most of them did not know why they had come together.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019033,'Then the Jews pushed Alexander forward, out from the crowd. So Alexander motioned with his hand and would have made a defense to the people.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019034,'But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019035,'When the city clerk had quieted the crowd, he said: “Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple guardian of the great goddess Artemis and of what fell from Zeus?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019036,'Therefore, since these things are undeniable, you ought to be quiet and not do anything rash.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019037,'You have arrested these men who are neither temple thieves nor blasphemers of your goddess.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019038,'Now if Demetrius and his fellow artisans have a complaint against anyone, courts are available, and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019039,'But if you want to debate any other matter, it will be settled in the legal assembly.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019040,'Indeed, we are in danger of being charged with a riot, because of today, there being no reason at all that we can give to account for this commotion.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344019041,'And having said these things he dismissed the assembly.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020001,'Now after the uproar had ended, Paul summoned the disciples, took leave of them, and set out for Macedonia.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020002,'When he had gone through those parts and encouraged them with many words, he came into Greece.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020003,'When he had stayed three months, as he was about to set sail for Syria, the Jews made a plot against him, so he decided to return through Macedonia.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020004,'Now Sopater of Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, Gaius of Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia were going to accompany him as far as Asia;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020005,'so having gone on ahead, these men were waiting for us in Troas.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020006,'But it was after the Days of Unleavened Bread that we sailed from Philippi, and in five days we joined them at Troas, where we stayed seven days.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020007,'Now on the first day of the week, the disciples being assembled to break bread, Paul started addressing them, and because he intended to leave the next day he continued his message until midnight.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020008,'There were many lamps in the upper room where we were assembled.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020009,'Well a certain young man named Eutychus sat in a window and was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul kept on talking; when he was overcome by the sleep he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020010,'So Paul went down, threw himself on him and embracing him said, “Do not be distressed, because his life is in him!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020011,'Then he went back up and broke bread, ate, and kept on speaking until daybreak—that is how he left!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020012,'(On their part, they led the boy away alive, and were greatly comforted.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020013,'As for us, we went to the ship and set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul on board there—so it had been arranged, he himself intending to go on foot.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020014,'When he met us at Assos we took him aboard and went on to Mityline.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020015,'Sailing from there, the next day we arrived opposite Chios, and the day after we crossed over to Samos and stopped in Trogylium; the following day we came to Miletus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020016,'(Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, to avoid being detained in Asia, because he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem on the Day of Pentecost, if he possibly could.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020017,'From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and summoned the elders of the congregation.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020018,'So when they had come to him he said to them: “You yourselves know, from the first day that I arrived in Asia, how I lived the whole time I was with you,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020019,'serving the Lord with all humility, and with many tears and trials, the ones that happened to me by the plots of the Jews;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020020,'how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, teaching you publicly and from house to house,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020021,'solemnly proclaiming to both Jews and Greeks the repentance toward God and the faith into our Lord Jesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020022,'Now then, I am going to Jerusalem bound in my spirit, not knowing the things that will happen to me there,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020023,'except that the Holy Spirit keeps warning me in every city, saying that fetters and afflictions are just waiting for me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020024,'However none of this moves me, nor do I regard my life as valuable to myself, just so that I may complete my course with joy, even the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to solemnly proclaim the Good News of the grace of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020025,'“Furthermore, I know that none of you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the Kingdom of God will ever see my face again.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020026,'Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020027,'because I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020028,'So take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers, to shepherd the congregation of the Lord and God which He purchased with His own blood.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020029,'Because I know this, that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020030,'Yes, men will rise up from among you yourselves, speaking distorted things, to draw away the disciples after them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020031,'Therefore be alert, remembering that during three years, night and day, I never stopped admonishing each one, with tears.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020032,'“And so now, brothers, I entrust you to God and to the Word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all those who have been sanctified.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020033,'I have not coveted anyone''s silver or gold or clothing.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020035,'In every way I showed you that working hard like this it is necessary to help the weak, and to remember the word of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ ”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020036,'When he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020037,'Then they all wept freely, and falling on Paul''s neck kept kissing him,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344020038,'sorrowing most of all because of the word that he had spoken, that they would see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344021001,'So after disengaging ourselves from them we were able to set sail, and running a straight course we came to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344021002,'We found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, went on board and set sail.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344021003,'When we had sighted Cyprus we passed it on the left, sailed on to Syria and landed at Tyre, because it was there that the ship was to unload the cargo.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344021030,'The whole city was aroused and a mob of people formed. So having seized Paul they dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344021031,'As they were trying to kill him, news came to the commander of the garrison that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344021032,'He immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down among them, and when they saw the commander and the soldiers they stopped beating Paul.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344021033,'Then the commander came up and took hold of him, commanded that he be bound with two chains, and started inquiring who he was and what he had done.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344021034,'Well some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another; so when he could not ascertain the truth, because of the uproar, he commanded him to be taken into the barracks.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344021035,'When he reached the stairs, he had to be carried by the soldiers, because of the violence of the mob.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344021036,'Because the crowd kept following and shouting, “Away with him!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344021037,'As Paul was about to be led into the barracks, he said to the commander, “May I speak to you?” So he said: “Do you know Greek?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344021038,'Aren''t you the Egyptian who some time ago started a revolt and led the four thousand men of ‘the Assassins’ out into the wilderness?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344021039,'But Paul said, “I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of a not insignificant city; but I beg you, allow me to speak to the people.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344021040,'So when he had given him permission, Paul stood on the stairs and motioned to the people with his hand. When there was a great silence, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022001,'“Men, brothers and fathers, listen to my defense before you now.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022002,'When they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they were even more quiet, and he said:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022003,'“I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, educated strictly according to the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, just as you all are today.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022004,'I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022005,'as also the high priest and all the council of elders can bear me witness. I even obtained letters from them to the brothers in Damascus, to bring those also who were there bound to Jerusalem to be punished.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022006,'Now it happened, as I was going and approaching Damascus, about noon, suddenly a strong light from heaven shone around me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022007,'I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022008,'So I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ He said to me, ‘I am Jesus the Natsorean, whom you are persecuting.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022009,'Those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid, but they did not understand the voice of the One speaking to me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022010,'So I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ And the Lord said to me, ‘Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about all that has been appointed to you to do.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022011,'And since I could not see, because of the brightness of that light, I entered Damascus being led by the hand of those who were with me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022012,'Then a certain Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who lived in Damascus,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022013,'came to me, and standing by me said, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ And at that very moment I looked up at him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022014,'Then he said: ‘The God of our fathers has chosen you to know His will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear words from His mouth.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022015,'For you shall be a witness for Him to all men of the things that you have seen and heard.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022017,'“Now it happened, when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I came to be in a trance'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022019,'So I said: ‘Lord, they know that I used to imprison and beat those believing into you, from one synagogue to another;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022020,'and when the blood of your witness Stephen was shed, I myself was standing there and agreeing to his murder, even guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022021,'And He said to me, ‘Get going, because I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’ ”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022022,'Well they kept listening to him until this statement, and then they raised their voice and shouted, “Rid the earth of this fellow, for it isn''t fitting for him to live!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022023,'As they were shouting, tearing off clothes and throwing dust into the air,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022024,'the commander ordered him to be taken into the barracks, directing that he be interrogated with lashes, in order to learn for what crime they kept shouting against him like that.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022025,'But as they stretched him out with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood by, “Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and uncondemned?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022026,'Well when the centurion heard that, he went and reported to the commander saying, “Consider what you are about to do, because this man is a Roman!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022027,'So the commander went and said to him, “Tell me, are you a Roman?” So he said, “Yes.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022028,'The commander replied, “I acquired this citizenship at considerable cost.” And Paul said, “But I was so born.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022029,'So those who were about to interrogate him withdrew immediately; and even the commander was apprehensive when he realized that he had put chains on a Roman.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344022030,'But the next day, desiring to know for certain why he was accused by the Jews, he freed him from the bonds and ordered the chief priests and all their council to come, and brought Paul down and set him before them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023001,'Then Paul, looking intently at the council, said, “Men, brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023002,'So the high priest Ananias commanded those standing by him to strike his mouth.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023003,'Then Paul said to him: “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you command me to be struck contrary to the law!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023004,'So those standing by said, “Do you reproach God''s high priest?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023005,'Then Paul said, “I did not know, brothers, that he is high priest; for it is written: ‘Do not speak evil of a ruler of your people.’ ”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023006,'Now when Paul perceived that one part were Pharisees and the other Sadducees, he called out in the council, “Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of a Pharisee; I am being judged concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023007,'When he had said this, an argument started between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023008,'(Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel or spirit, but Pharisees confess both.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023009,'There was a great clamor, and the scribes of the Pharisee party stood up and started arguing vigorously, saying, “We find nothing wrong with this man; but if a spirit or angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023010,'Well the dissension became such that the commander, fearing that Paul might be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and snatch him out of their midst and bring him into the barracks.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023011,'Now the following night the Lord stood by him and said, “Take courage, Paul, because as you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023012,'And when it was day, some of the Jews formed a conspiracy by binding themselves with a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they had destroyed Paul.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023013,'Now there were more than forty who formed this plot.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023014,'They came to the chief priests and the elders and said: “We have bound ourselves with a terrible curse not to taste anything until we have killed Paul.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023015,'Now you, therefore, together with the council, explain to the commander that he should bring him down to you tomorrow, as though you are going to determine more accurately the facts in his case; but we are ready to destroy him before he comes near.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023016,'But when Paul''s sister''s son heard about the ambush, he went and entered the barracks and told Paul.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023017,'So Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the commander, because he has something to tell him.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023018,'So he took him and brought him to the commander and said, “Paul the prisoner called me over and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023019,'So taking him by the hand, the commander went aside and asked privately, “What is it that you have to tell me?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023020,'So he said: “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow as though intending to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023021,'But you should not believe them, because more than forty of their men are lying in wait for him, who have bound themselves with a curse neither to eat not to drink until they have destroyed him; even now they are ready, looking for your promise.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023022,'Then the commander dismissed the young man commanding, “Don''t tell anyone that you have revealed these things to me!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023023,'Summoning two of the centurions he said: “Prepare two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at the third hour of the night;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023024,'and provide mounts to set Paul on so as to deliver him safely to Felix, the governor.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023025,'He wrote a letter with this content:'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023027,'This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them; but I came with the troops and rescued him, having learned that he is a Roman.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023028,'And wanting to know the reason they were accusing him, I took him down to their council.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023029,'I found that he was being accused about questions of their law, but there was no accusation worthy of death or bonds.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023030,'When I was told that the Jews were about to execute a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, also directing his accusers to state the charges against him before you. Farewell.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023031,'So the soldiers, according to their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023032,'The next day they left the horsemen to go on with him and returned to the barracks.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023033,'When they entered Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023034,'When the governor read it, he asked what province he was from; learning that it was Cilicia,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344023035,'he said, “I will give you a hearing when your accusers also arrive.” And he commanded him to be guarded in Herod''s Praetorium.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024001,'Now after five days the high priest Ananias went down with the elders and a certain orator, Tertullus, and they informed the governor against Paul.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024002,'So when he had been called in, Tertullus began his accusation, saying: “Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and your foresight has brought prosperity to this nation,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024003,'we recognize this, most noble Felix, with full gratitude, always and everywhere.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024004,'But so as not to detain you unduly, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024005,'We have found this man to be a plague, a creator of discord among all the Jews throughout the world, a ringleader of the Natsorean sect,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024006,'and he even tried to profane the temple; so we arrested him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024008,'By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024009,'And the Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024010,'When the governor had nodded to him to speak, Paul answered: “Knowing, as I do, that you have been an equitable judge of this nation for many years, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024011,'because you can ascertain that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024012,'They did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd—not in the temple, not in the synagogues, not around the city.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024013,'Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024014,'But I do profess this to you, that according to the Way that they call a sect, that is how I worship the ancestral God, believing all things that stand written throughout the Law and the Prophets,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024015,'having hope in God, which these themselves also look for, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both the just and unjust.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024016,'And this is why I apply myself to always have a clear conscience before both God and men.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024017,'Now after many years I came to bring alms and offerings to my nation,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024018,'in the midst of which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, with neither crowd nor confusion.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024019,'They are the ones that had to be here before you and make accusation, if they had anything against me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024020,'Or let these themselves say what wrong they found in me, when I stood before the council,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024021,'unless it be for this one statement that I called out, standing among them, ‘Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged by you today.’ ”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024022,'Upon hearing these things Felix, having an accurate knowledge of the things concerning the Way, adjourned the proceedings and said, “When Lysias the commander comes down I will decide your case.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024023,'And he ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody but have some freedom, and not to forbid any of his friends to provide for or to visit him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024024,'Now after some days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith into Christ Jesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024025,'But as he expounded on righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix became afraid and answered, “Go away for now; when I have occasion I will summon you.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024026,'At the same time he was also hoping that Paul would give him money, that he might release him; so he frequently summoned and conversed with him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344024027,'But after two years, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; so Felix, wanting to do the Jews a favor, left Paul in prison.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025001,'Now upon assuming the province, after three days Festus went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025002,'Then the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul and started importuning him,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025003,'begging a favor from him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem—preparing an ambush to kill him along the way.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025004,'However Festus answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, he himself being about to go there shortly.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025005,'He said, “So let those who are competent among you go down with me; if there is anything against this man, let them accuse him.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025006,'When he had stayed among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea; the next day he sat on the judgment seat and commanded Paul to be brought.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025007,'When he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem made a circle, bringing against Paul many serious charges that they could not prove,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025008,'while he defended himself, “Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar did I commit any sin.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025009,'But Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor, answered Paul by saying, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem to be judged by me there concerning these things?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025010,'So Paul said: “I am standing before Caesar''s judgment seat, where I ought to be tried. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as even you know very well.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025011,'Now if I really am in the wrong and have perpetrated anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if there is nothing to the things of which these are accusing me, no one has the right to give me to them. I appeal to Caesar!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025012,'Then Festus, when he had conferred with his counsel, answered: “You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you shall go!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025013,'Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived in Caesarea to congratulate Festus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025014,'Since they were spending many days there, Festus laid Paul''s case before the king, saying: “There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025015,'about whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, asking for punishment against him;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025016,'to whom I answered that it is not a custom with Romans to deliver any man to destruction before the accused has his accusers face to face and has opportunity for defense against the accusation.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025017,'So when they had assembled here, without any delay, the next day I sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025018,'When the accusers stood up, they brought no charge against him of such things as I supposed,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025019,'but had certain issues against him about their religion, and about a certain dead Jesus whom Paul affirmed to be living.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025020,'And since I was at a loss how to investigate such matters, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and be judged there concerning these things.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025021,'But when Paul appealed to be reserved for the decision of the Emperor, I commanded him to be kept until I can send him to Caesar.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025022,'Then Agrippa said to Festus, “I myself would also like to hear the man.” So he said, “Tomorrow you shall hear him.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025023,'So the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp and entered the auditorium, with the commanding officers and the more prominent men of the city, at Festus'' command Paul was brought in.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025024,'And Festus said: “King Agrippa, and all you men who are here with us: consider this man, about whom the whole Jewish community petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, vociferating that it was not fitting for him to live any longer.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025025,'But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, besides he himself having appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025026,'But I have nothing certain to write to my lord concerning him. Therefore I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the examination I may have something to write.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344025027,'Because it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not to specify the charges against him.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026001,'Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.” So Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026002,'“I consider myself fortunate, King Agrippa, in that I am to make my defense before you this day concerning the things of which I am accused by the Jews,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026003,'especially because you are expert in all the Jewish customs and issues; therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026004,'Really, the Jews all know my way of life from my youth, which was spent from the beginning among my own nation in Jerusalem,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026005,'since they have known me for a long time, if they were willing to testify, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived as a Pharisee.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026006,'And now I stand here being judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026007,'to which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving God night and day, hope to attain. It is because of this hope that I am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026008,'Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026009,'“However, I myself thought that I had to perpetrate many things in opposition to the name of Jesus the Natsorean;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026010,'I actually did this in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death I cast my vote against them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026011,'Yes, I punished them often in every synagogue, trying to force them to blaspheme; I was so excessively enraged against them that I persecuted them even to foreign cities.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026012,'“It was on one of those journeys, as I was going to Damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026013,'at midday, O king, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven brighter than the sun, blazing around me and those traveling with me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026014,'Well we all fell to the ground and I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew language: ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026015,'So I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And He said: ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026016,'Now get up and stand on your feet; because I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a servant and a witness both of the things you have seen and of the things I will reveal to you,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026017,'delivering you from ‘the people’ and the ethnic nations, to which I am sending you:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026018,'to open their eyes, so as to bring them back from darkness into light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified, by faith into me.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026019,'Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026020,'—first to those in Damascus and Jerusalem, then to all the region of Judea and to the ethnic nations, I still preach: ‘repent and turn back to God, doing works worthy of repentance.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026021,'That is why the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026022,'So then, having experienced the help that is from God, I stand to this day testifying to both small and great, saying nothing beyond what both the prophets and Moses said would happen'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026023,'—that the Messiah would suffer; that as the first to rise from the dead He would proclaim light to both ‘the people’ and the ethnic nations.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026024,'Well as he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice: “Paul, you are crazy! Your great learning is driving you insane!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026025,'So he said: “I am not crazy, most excellent Festus; rather I pronounce words of truth and reasonableness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026026,'For the king knows about these things, before whom I speak freely; for I am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice, since it was not done in a corner.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026027,'King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026028,'So Agrippa said to Paul, “You will soon persuade me to become a Christian!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026029,'So Paul said, “Whether sooner or later, I would to God that not only you but also all who are hearing me this day may become such as I am, except for these chains.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026030,'Upon his saying this, the king stood up, along with the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026031,'and when they had withdrawn they started talking among themselves, saying, “This man is doing nothing deserving of death or chains.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344026032,'And Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free, if he had not appealed to Caesar.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027001,'Now when it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the imperial cohort.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027002,'So we embarked in a ship of Atramytium, being about to sail to points along the Asian coast, and we put to sea; Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027003,'The next day we landed at Sidon; Julius treated Paul kindly and permitted him to go to his friends and receive care.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027004,'Putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027005,'And when we had sailed across the sea that is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027006,'There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy and put us on board.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027007,'When we had sailed slowly many days and scarcely arrived opposite Cnidus, the wind did not allow us to go forward, so we sailed for the lee of Crete by way of Salmone;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027008,'sailing along it with difficulty we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027009,'Much time had been lost and sailing was already dangerous, because even the Fast had already taken place; Paul repeatedly warned them'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027010,'saying, “Men, I perceive that the voyage is about to be with damage and great loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but even of our lives.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027011,'But the centurion was persuaded by the pilot and ship owner rather than by what Paul said.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027012,'And since the harbor was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised sailing on, to see if they could get to Phoenix in order to winter, it being a harbor of Crete facing southwest and northwest.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027013,'So when the south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to shore.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027014,'But not long after, a cyclonic wind blasted down from the land (it is called Euroclydon).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027015,'Well the ship was caught and could not head into the wind, so we gave up and were driven along.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027016,'Running under the lee of a small island called Clauda, we barely managed to secure the skiff;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027017,'when they had hoisted it aboard, they used cables to undergird the ship; and fearing that they might fall into the Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and so were driven along.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027018,'We were being so violently battered by the storm that the next day they began to jettison things,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027019,'and on the third we threw off the ship''s tackle with our own hands.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027020,'When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and a major storm was still pounding us, all hope that we would be saved was now taken away.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027021,'Now after long abstinence from food, Paul stood up in the midst of them and said: “Well men, it would have been better to take my advice and not sail from Crete, only to ‘gain’ this damage and loss.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027022,'But now I urge you to take heart, because there will be no loss of life among you, only of the ship.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027023,'This night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood by me'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027024,'and said: ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. Furthermore, God has granted you all those who sail with you.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027025,'So take courage, men, because I believe in God that it will be just as it was told me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027026,'Also, we must run aground on a certain island.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027027,'Now when the fourteenth night had come, as we were being driven here and there in the Adriatic, about midnight the sailors sensed that they were nearing some land.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027028,'They took a sounding and found twenty fathoms; going on a little they took a sounding again and found fifteen fathoms.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027029,'So fearing that we might be driven into a rocky area, they dropped four anchors from the stern and started praying for day to come.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027030,'Now under pretense of putting out anchors from the prow, the sailors lowered the skiff into the sea, intending to flee from the ship;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027031,'so Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, “Unless these stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027032,'Then the soldiers severed the ropes of the skiff and let it fall away.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027033,'While the day was coming on, Paul started urging them all to receive food, saying: “Today is the fourteenth day of waiting—you continue without eating, having taken nothing.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027034,'Therefore I urge you to take nourishment, because this is for our survival, since not a hair will fall from the head of any of you.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027035,'Upon saying this he picked up some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all; then he broke it and began to eat.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027036,'So they all were encouraged and took food themselves.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027037,'(In all, we were two hundred seventy-six souls on the ship.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027038,'So when they had eaten enough, they started lightening the ship by throwing out the wheat into the sea.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027039,'When it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, onto which they planned to run the ship, if possible.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027040,'Casting off the anchors they left them in the sea, at the same time untying the rudder ropes; and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027041,'But they fell into a place where two seas met and ran the vessel aground; the prow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern began to be broken up by the violence of the waves.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027042,'Now the plan of the soldiers was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim away and escape.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027043,'But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, stopped them from doing it and ordered those who could swim to jump in first and go toward the land,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344027044,'followed by the rest, some on planks and some on things from the ship. And in this way they all escaped safely to the land.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028001,'Following the rescue, they learned that the island was called Malta.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028002,'Now the natives showed us unusual kindness, in that they kindled a fire and welcomed us all, because it had begun to rain and was cold.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028003,'But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and placed them on the fire, because of the heat a viper came out and fastened itself on his hand.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028004,'So when the natives saw the beast hanging from his hand, they started saying to each other, “This man must be a murderer, whom Justice has not allowed to live, even though rescued from the sea.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028005,'But he just shook the beast off into the fire and suffered no harm.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028006,'Well they were expecting him to swell up, or suddenly fall down dead; but after waiting for quite a while and seeing nothing unusual happening to him, they changed their mind and started saying he was a god.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028007,'Now in that region there were properties belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and in a friendly manner took care of us for three days.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028008,'Well it happened that the father of Publius was sick in bed with fever and dysentery; Paul went in to him, prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028009,'So, when this had happened, the rest of those on the island who had diseases started coming and being healed;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028010,'who also honored us in many ways, and when we put to sea they provided the necessary things.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028011,'Now after three months we put to sea in an Alexandrian ship that had wintered in the island, whose figurehead was ‘the Twin Brothers’.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028012,'We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028013,'from there we tacked back and forth and arrived at Rhegium. After one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028014,'where we found brothers who urged us to stay there seven days—that was how we went toward Rome.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028015,'And the brothers there, when they heard about our circumstances, came out to meet us as far as Appii Forum and Three Inns. When Paul saw them he thanked God and took courage.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028016,'Now when we entered Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the commander; but Paul was allowed to live by himself, with the soldier who guarded him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028017,'It happened that after three days Paul called together the leaders of the Jews; and when they had assembled he said to them: “Men, brothers, though I had done nothing against ‘the people’ or the ancestral customs, still I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028018,'who, when they had examined me, were intending to release me, because I was not guilty of any crime deserving death.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028019,'But when the Jews spoke against it, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar; not that I had anything about which to accuse my nation.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028020,'For this reason therefore I asked to see you and speak with you; it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028021,'So they said to him: “We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brothers who came reported or spoken any evil about you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028022,'But we desire to hear from you what you think; because as for this sect, we know that it is spoken against everywhere.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028023,'So arranging a day with him, even more people came to him at his lodging, to whom he kept expounding from morning until evening: solemnly testifying about the Kingdom of God and trying to convince them concerning Jesus, from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028024,'Well some were persuaded by what had been said, and some kept refusing to believe.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028025,'So being in disagreement among themselves they started to leave, after Paul had said this one word: “The Holy Spirit spoke correctly to our fathers through Isaiah the prophet,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028026,'saying: ‘Go to this people and say, “You will keep on hearing, but never understand; you will keep on seeing, but never perceive”;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028027,'because the heart of this people has become sluggish, and their ears are hard of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; in order that they not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their heart, nor turn back, so I could heal them.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028028,'Therefore let it be known to you that the salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028029,'And when he had said these things the Jews went their way, having a great dispute among themselves.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028030,'Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who came to see him,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,344028031,'proclaiming the Kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all boldness, without hindrance.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001001,'Paul, a slave of Jesus Christ, a called apostle, having been set apart to the Gospel of God,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001002,'which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001003,'concerning His Son, who became a physical descendant of David,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001004,'who was established to be God''s powerful Son (in accordance with Spirit of holiness) by resurrection from the dead—Jesus Christ our Lord—'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001008,'First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001009,'Further, the God whom I serve with my spirit in the Gospel of His Son is my witness, how without ceasing I always remember you in my prayers,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001011,'For I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, so that you may be established'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001012,'—that is, that I may be encouraged among you by our mutual faith, both yours and mine.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001013,'I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I often planned to come to you (but was hindered until now), in order that I might have some fruit among you also, just as among the rest of the Gentiles.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001014,'I am a debtor both to Greeks and to non-Greeks, both to wise and to foolish.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001015,'So, for my part, I am eager to preach the Gospel to you who are in Rome as well.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001016,'I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, because it is the power of God for the salvation of each one who believes (for the Jew first, then the Greek);'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001017,'because in it God''s righteousness is revealed, from faith to faith; just as it is written: “The righteous one will live by faith.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001018,'Now the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of the people who suppress the truth by unrighteousness,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001019,'precisely because what may be known about God is evident among them, because God has shown it to them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001020,'Because His invisible attributes, namely His eternal power and divine nature, are clearly seen from the creation of the world, being understood from what has been made, so that they are inexcusable;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001021,'precisely because, knowing God, they neither glorified Him as God nor gave thanks; so their reasonings became worthless and their senseless hearts were darkened.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001022,'Claiming to be wise, they became fools,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001023,'and exchanged for themselves the glory of the incorruptible God for an image resembling a perishable man—even birds and quadrupeds and reptiles!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001024,'Therefore God also gave them up, through the cravings of their hearts for vileness, to the degrading of their bodies among themselves'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001025,'—they had exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001026,'For this reason God gave them up to degrading passions; in fact even their females exchanged the natural sexual function for that against nature;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001027,'likewise also the males, abandoning the natural use of the female, were inflamed in their lust toward one another, males committing the disgraceful act with males, and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001028,'So precisely because they determined not to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a debased mind, to do wrong things:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001029,'having been filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, greed, depravity; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity; gossips,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001030,'slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant, braggarts, contrivers of evil things, disobedient to parents,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001031,'senseless, faithless, hardhearted, intransigent, unmerciful;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345001032,'who, knowing full well God''s just sentence, that those who practice such things are deserving of death, not only do them but also approve of other practitioners.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002001,'Now then, you there, whoever you are who judges someone else for things you practice yourself—you condemn yourself and are inexcusable.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002002,'Further, we know that God''s judgment against those who practice such things is according to truth.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002003,'So then, you there, you who judge those who practice such things while doing the same, do you really imagine that you will escape God''s judgment?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002004,'Or do you scorn the riches of His kindness, tolerance and longsuffering, not recognizing that the goodness of God is leading you toward repentance?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002005,'Rather, due to your hardness and unrepentant heart, you are treasuring up wrath for yourself in the day of God''s wrath and revelation and righteous judgment,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002006,'who will repay each one according to his works:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002007,'to those who seek for glory, honor and incorruption, by persevering in doing good—eternal life;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002008,'but to those who, due to self-seeking, are actually disobeying the truth (while obeying the unrighteousness)—fury and wrath,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002009,'tribulation and anguish, upon every human soul who works at the evil, whether Jew (first) or Greek;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002010,'but glory, honor and peace to everyone who works the good, whether Jew (first) or Greek.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002011,'Now there is no favoritism with God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002012,'For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law; while as many as have sinned with law will be judged by law.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002013,'For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002014,'(indeed, whenever the ethnic nations that do not have law do by nature the things of the law, these, although not having law, are a law to themselves;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002015,'who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their reasonings among themselves accusing or even excusing)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002016,'in the day when God, according to my Gospel, will judge people''s secrets by Jesus Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002017,'Look, you declare yourself a Jew, and rest on the Law, and boast in God,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002018,'and know the Will, and approve the superior things, being instructed out of the Law.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002019,'Further, you are confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those in darkness,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002020,'an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and truth.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002021,'You then, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach not to steal, do you steal?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002022,'You who say not to commit adultery, do you adulterate? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002023,'You who boast in the Law, do you dishonor God through the transgression of the Law?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002024,'For, just as it is written: “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002025,'Now circumcision does have value if you keep the Law, but if you are a transgressor of the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002026,'So if the uncircumcised keeps the righteous requirements of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be counted as circumcision?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002027,'And will not the physically uncircumcised who fulfills the law judge you, complete with written code and circumcision, who are a transgressor of the Law?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002028,'Because a person is not a true Jew who is only one outwardly, nor is true circumcision something outward in the flesh;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345002029,'but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart—in spirit, not letter—whose praise is not from men but from God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003001,'So what advantage does the Jew have, or what is the profit of circumcision?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003002,'Much in every way! First of all, because they were entrusted with the oracles of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003003,'So, what if some did not believe? Their unbelief will not nullify God''s faithfulness, will it?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003004,'Of course not! Rather, let God be found true, but every man a liar; just as it is written: “That you may be justified in your words, and may overcome when you are judged.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003005,'Now if our unrighteousness highlights God''s righteousness, what shall we say? God is not unrighteous for inflicting His wrath, is He? (I speak as a man.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003006,'Of course not! Otherwise, how will God judge the world?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003007,'Still, if the truth of God abounded to His glory by my falsehood, just why am I still judged as a sinner?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003008,'However, we must not say, “Let us do evil so that good may come” (as some people slanderously claim that we do)—their condemnation is well deserved!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003009,'What then? Are we any better? Not at all! For we have already charged both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003010,'Just as it is written: “No one is righteous, not even one;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003011,'there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003012,'All have turned aside, together they have been made useless; there is no one who shows kindness, no, not so much as one.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003013,'“Their throat is an opened grave; they habitually deceive with their tongues.” “Viper''s venom is under their lips”;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003018,'“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003019,'Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be shut and the whole world become accountable to God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003020,'It follows that no flesh will be justified in His sight by the works of the law, because through the law comes the real knowledge of sin.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003021,'But now, apart from law, a righteousness from God has been revealed, being attested by the Law and the Prophets,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003022,'namely, a righteousness from God through faith in Jesus Christ, into all and upon all those who believe. There is no difference:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003023,'all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003024,'being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003025,'whom God has openly made available as a propitiation through the faith in His blood, to demonstrate His righteousness because of the passing over, in God''s forbearance, of the previously committed sins;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003027,'Where then is the boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law, that of works? No, but by a law of faith.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003028,'Therefore we conclude that a person is justified by faith apart from works of law.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003029,'Or is God for Jews only? Is He not also for Gentiles? Yes, also for Gentiles,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003030,'since indeed there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through the Faith.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345003031,'Do we then nullify law through the Faith? Of course not! Rather, we uphold law.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004001,'What then shall we say that our father Abraham discovered, as a man?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004002,'If Abraham was really justified by works, he has a boast—but not before God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004003,'So what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004004,'Now to him who works, the pay is not counted as a gift but as an obligation.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004005,'But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004006,'Just as David speaks of the blessing of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004007,'“Blessed are they whose lawless deeds have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered up.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004008,'Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004009,'Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? Since we say that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004011,'And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness from his faith while still uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all those who believe while uncircumcised, in order that this righteousness may be credited to them also,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004012,'and the father of the circumcised—not only those who are circumcised, but especially those who follow in the footsteps of the faith of our father Abraham while still uncircumcised.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004013,'Now the promise that he would be the heir of the world was not to Abraham, or his seed, through law, but through the righteousness of faith.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004014,'For if those who are of law are heirs, the faith is made empty and the promise has been invalidated;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004015,'because the law produces wrath, since where there is no law neither is there transgression.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004016,'For this reason it is of faith so that it may be according to grace, in order that the promise be guaranteed to all the seed—not only to those of law, but also to those of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004017,'just as it is written: “I have made you a father of many ethnic nations”—in the presence of Him whom he believed: God, who gives life to the dead and calls the nonexistent things as though they did exist.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004018,'Contrary to hope, Abraham in hope believed, so as to become a father of many ethnic nations, according to what had been spoken: “So shall your seed be.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004019,'And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body, already dead (being about a hundred years old), or the deadness of Sarah''s womb.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004020,'He did not waver at God''s promise in unbelief; rather, he was strengthened by the faith, giving glory to God,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004022,'—that is why it was credited to him as righteousness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345004023,'Now it was not only for his sake that it was written that it was credited to him,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345005003,'Not only so, but we should also rejoice in the sufferings, knowing that the suffering produces perseverance;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345005004,'and the perseverance, proven character; and the proven character, hope;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345005006,'Now then, when we were incapacitated, even so Christ died for the ungodly, at the right moment.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345005009,'So now that we have been justified by His blood, how much more shall we be saved from the wrath through Him!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345005010,'Because since we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, while we were enemies, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through His life!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345005011,'No wonder we rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345005012,'Now then, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, just so death spread to all men, because all sinned'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345005013,'—sin was in the world before the law, to be sure, but sin is not imputed when there is no law.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345005014,'Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin in the likeness of Adam''s transgression (he is a type of the coming one).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345005015,'Now the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one, how much more did God''s grace and the bounty by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345005016,'Again, the gift is not like what came from one man''s having sinned: because the judgment into condemnation followed one offense, while the gracious gift into justification followed many offenses.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345005017,'Further, if by the offense of the one man death reigned through that man, much more will those who receive the abundance of the grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345005018,'So then, as through one offense there is condemnation for everyone, so also through one righteous act there is life-giving justification for everyone.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345005019,'For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were constituted sinners, so also through the obedience of the One the many will be constituted righteous.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345005020,'However, law came on the scene so that the offense might abound; but where the sin abounded, the grace superabounded,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345005021,'so that just as sin reigned in the death, so also the grace might reign through righteousness into eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006001,'So what shall we say? Shall we continue in the sin so that the grace may abound?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006002,'Of course not! How can we who died to sin keep on living in it?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006003,'Or are you unaware that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006004,'Therefore, we were buried with Him by means of that baptism into that death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by means of the Father''s glory, we also should walk in newness of life.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006005,'Now if we have become united with Him in His death, we will certainly be in His resurrection as well;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006006,'knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him in order that the body of the sin might be set aside, so that we no longer be enslaved to that sin—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006007,'because he who has died has been released from that sin.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006008,'Now since we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006009,'knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, cannot die again; death can no longer master Him'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006010,'—the death He died He died to sin once for all, while the life He lives He lives to God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006011,'Thus you also, consider yourselves to be dead indeed to the sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006012,'Therefore do not let the sin reign in your mortal body, so that you obey it with the body''s evil desires'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006013,'—do not present any part of your body to sin as an implement for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead, and your body parts to God as implements for righteousness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006014,'Really, sin must not rule over you, because you are not under law but under grace.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006015,'What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Of course not!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006016,'Do you not know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey them as slaves, you are slaves to the one whom you obey—whether of sin into death, or of obedience into righteousness?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006017,'But thanks be to God that although you used to be the slaves of the sin you wholeheartedly obeyed that pattern of doctrine into which you were delivered.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006018,'So having been emancipated from the sin, you became enslaved to the righteousness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006019,'I continue to speak on a human level because of the weakness of your flesh. Now just as you used to present your body parts as slaves to uncleanness, and to ever increasing lawlessness, so now present your body parts as slaves to righteousness with a view to sanctification.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006020,'For when you were slaves to the sin, you were ‘free’ from the righteousness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006021,'So what ‘fruit’ did you have at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? The end of those things is death!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006022,'But now, having been emancipated from the sin, and having become enslaved to God, you have your ‘fruit’ into sanctification—and the end is eternal life!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345006023,'Because the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007001,'Do you not know, brothers (for I am speaking to those who know law), that the law has authority over someone only as long as he lives?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007002,'For example, a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives, but if the man should die, she is released from the law about the husband.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007003,'So then, if she should ‘marry’ another man while her husband is living, she will be labeled an adulteress; but if the husband should die, she is free from that law, not being an adulteress if she marries another man.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007004,'Therefore, my brothers, you also were put to death to the law through the body of the Christ so as to belong to another—to Him who was raised from the dead—so that we should produce fruit to God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007005,'Because when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our body parts to produce fruit to death.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007006,'But now we have been released from the law, having died to what was gripping us, so as to slave in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007007,'So what shall we say then? Is the law sin? Of course not! Indeed, I would not have come to know the sin except through the law: I would not have recognized covetousness if the law had not said, “You must not covet.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007008,'But the sin, grasping an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting. Now without the law sin is dead.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007009,'Once upon a time, without law, I was actually ‘alive’; but when the commandment came, the sin came to life and I died.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007010,'Yes, the commandment that was to bring me life turned out to bring death.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007011,'Because the sin, grasping an opportunity through the commandment, completely deceived me, and used it to ‘kill’ me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007012,'So then, the law itself is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007013,'So has what is good become death to me? Of course not! Rather the sin, that it might be exposed as sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that through the commandment the sin might become extremely sinful.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007014,'We know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, having been ‘sold’ under sin'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007015,'—you see, I do not understand what I am doing: I do not practice what I want to do, but I do what I hate!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007016,'But if I do what I do not want to do, I agree with the law that it is good.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007017,'So now it is no longer I who am doing it, but the sin dwelling in me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007018,'Further, I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; because to will is present with me, but I do not find how to perform the good.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007019,'Because I do not do the good that I want to do; rather I practice the evil that I do not want to do.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007020,'Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but the sin dwelling in me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007021,'So I find this ‘law’: when I want to do good, evil is right there with me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007022,'I joyfully agree with God''s law according to the inner man,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007023,'but I see a different ‘law’ in my body parts, warring against the law of my mind and taking me captive to the law of the sin that is in my body parts.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007024,'What a wretched man I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345007025,'I thank God—through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with the mind I myself serve God''s law, but with the flesh, sin''s law.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008001,'Now then, there is no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008002,'because the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of the sin and the death.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008003,'Further, what the law could not do, in that it was weak due to the flesh, God has done by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned the sin in the flesh,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008004,'so that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008005,'Those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008006,'Further, the mindset of the flesh yields death, but the mindset of the Spirit yields life and peace;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008007,'because the mindset of the flesh represents enmity against God, since it does not submit to God''s law, nor indeed can it.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008008,'So, those who are ‘in flesh’ cannot please God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008009,'You, however, are not ‘in flesh’ but ‘in Spirit’, if indeed God''s Spirit dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008010,'But if Christ is in you, the body is dead through sin, but the Spirit is life through righteousness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008011,'And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, then He who raised the Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of His Spirit who dwells in you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008012,'So then, brothers, we have no obligation to the flesh, to live according to it;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008013,'because if you live according to the flesh, you are about to die; but if you put to death the practices of the body, by the Spirit, you will live.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008014,'Because as many as are led by God''s Spirit, these are God''s sons'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008015,'—you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fear all over again, but you did receive the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008016,'That Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are God''s children'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008017,'—if children, also heirs: heirs of God and coheirs with Christ (if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008018,'I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is going to be revealed in us.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008019,'You see, the creation waits with eager anticipation for the revelation of God''s sons;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008020,'because without choice the creation was subjected to futility, due to the One who did the subjecting, based on the hope'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008022,'Yes, we know that the whole creation has been groaning and in labor pains until now.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008023,'Not only that, we ourselves also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we groan within ourselves, eagerly awaiting adoption, the redemption of our body.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008024,'Yes, we were saved in the hope, but a hope that is seen is not hope—why would anyone hope for what he sees?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008025,'But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly await it with endurance.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008026,'Likewise also the Spirit comes to the aid of the hope in our weaknesses, since we do not know what we need to pray for. Indeed the Spirit Himself intercedes on our behalf with inexpressible groanings,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008028,'Further, we know that all things work together for good for those who love God, for those who are called according to purpose.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008029,'Because whom He foreknew He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brothers.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008030,'Further, whom He predestined, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008031,'What then shall we say to these things? Since God is for us, who is against us?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008032,'He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up on behalf of us all, how shall He not with Him also graciously give us all things?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008033,'Who will bring a charge against God''s chosen ones? God is He who justifies.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008034,'Who is he who condemns? Christ is He who died, but even more, was indeed raised, who indeed is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes on our behalf.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008035,'Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Will it be affliction or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008036,'(As it is written: “For your sake we are being put to death all day long; we are accounted as sheep for slaughter.”)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345008037,'No, in all these things we prevail completely through Him who loved us.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010004,'Now for everyone who believes into righteousness, Christ is the end of the law'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010005,'—Moses writes about the righteousness that is from the law: “The person who does these things will live by them.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010006,'But the righteousness that is from faith speaks like this: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ down)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010007,'“or, ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010008,'So what does it say? “The message is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the message of faith that we proclaim):'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010009,'That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010010,'Because with the heart one believes into righteousness, and with the mouth one promises into salvation.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010011,'Because the Scripture says: “Everyone who believes on Him will never be put to shame”;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010012,'because there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, since the same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010013,'because: “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010014,'How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how can they believe on Him of whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without someone proclaiming it?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010015,'And how will they proclaim unless they are sent? As it is written: “How timely is the arrival of those who bring good news of peace, of those who announce the good things.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010016,'(However, they did not all obey the gospel; because Isaiah says: “Lord, who has believed our message?”)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010017,'So, the faith is from a message, and that message is by the Word of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010018,'But I say, did they really not hear? Indeed yes: “Their voice has gone out into all the earth, and their spoken words to the ends of the inhabited world.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010019,'Again I say, did Israel really not know? First Moses says: “I will provoke you to jealousy by a non-nation, I will move you to anger by a senseless nation.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010020,'But Isaiah is so bold as to say: “I was found by those who were not seeking me; I was revealed to those who were not asking for me.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345010021,'But concerning Israel he says: “All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011001,'So now I say, God did not reject His people, did He? Of course not! Why I myself am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011002,'God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says about Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel saying:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011003,'“Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to take my life!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011004,'But what does the divine response say to him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011005,'Even so then at this present time, there is a remnant according to an election by grace.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011006,'Now if by grace, it is no longer from works; otherwise the grace is no longer grace. But if from works, it is no longer grace; otherwise the work is no longer work.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011007,'What then? What Israel is seeking, this it did not obtain; but the election did obtain it, while the rest were dulled.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011008,'Just as it is written: “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that were not to see and ears that were not to hear, to this very day.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011009,'And David says: “Let their table be made into a snare and into a trap, into a stumbling block and into a retribution to them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011010,'Let their eyes be darkened so as not to see, and their back always be bowed down.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011011,'So now I say, surely they have not stumbled so as to fall and stay fallen? Of course not! Rather, through their transgression the salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011012,'Now if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss riches for the nations, how much more their fulfillment!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011013,'So I am speaking to you Gentiles (inasmuch as I am ‘apostle to the Gentiles’, I magnify my ministry),'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011014,'if somehow I can provoke my own people to jealousy and save some of them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011015,'For if their being rejected means reconciliation for the world, what will their restoration be but life from the dead?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011016,'Now if the ‘firstfruit’ is holy, so is the whole batch; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011017,'Now if some of the branches were broken off, while you, being a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among them, and with them have become a partaker of the root and the rich sap of the cultivated olive,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011018,'do not boast against those branches (since if you do boast—it is not you who support the root but the root you).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011019,'You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011020,'Granted. Because of unbelief they were broken off, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but fear!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011021,'Because if God did not spare the natural branches, perhaps He will not spare you either!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011022,'So consider the kindness and severity of God: upon those who fell, severity; but toward you, kindness, if you continue in that kindness; otherwise you too will be cut off.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011023,'And even they, if they do not persist in the unbelief, will be grafted back in, because God has the power to graft them in again.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011024,'For if you were cut out of a wild by nature olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011025,'Brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant of this ‘mystery’ (so that you not be conceited): hardening has come upon Israel in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011026,'And so all Israel will be saved, just as it is written: “The Deliverer will come out of Zion, and He will turn ungodliness away from Jacob;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011027,'this is my covenant with them, when I take away their sins.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011028,'On the one hand, regarding the Gospel, they are enemies because of you; on the other, regarding the election, they are beloved on account of the forefathers.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011029,'Because God''s gracious gifts and calling are irrevocable.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011030,'For just as you also were once disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy through their disobedience,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011031,'so also these have now been disobedient that through the mercy shown to you they also may be shown mercy.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011032,'Yes, God has given everyone over to disobedience so that He might show mercy to all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011033,'Oh, the depth of the riches of God''s wisdom and knowledge! How unsearchable His judgments and untraceable His ways!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011034,'Because “Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counselor?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011035,'Or “Who has ever given to Him and has to be repaid?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345011036,'Because from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever! Amen.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345012001,'Now then, brothers, I exhort you, in view of God''s compassions, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, satisfying to God—your intelligent duty.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345012002,'Yes, stop conforming to the pattern of this world; rather, be transformed by the renewing of your mind so as to be able to experience the good and satisfying and perfect will of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345012003,'Based on the grace given to me, I say to everyone among you not to set your sights higher than you should, but set them sensibly, as God has apportioned a measure of faith to each.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345012004,'Because just as in one body we have many parts, but all the parts do not have the same function,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345012005,'so we, who are many, are one body in Christ and individually members of one another.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345012006,'Since we have different spiritual gifts according to the grace that was given us, let us use them: if prophecy, according to the analogy of the Faith;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345012018,'If possible, what depends on you, live at peace with everyone.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345012019,'Dear ones, do not avenge yourselves; rather give place to the wrath; for it is written: “Vengeance is up to me; I will repay,” says the Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345012020,'Therefore, “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing this you will heap coals of fire on his head.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345013001,'Let every soul submit to the governing authorities, because there is no authority except under God, and the existing authorities have been placed by God.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345013004,'because it is God''s minister to you with a view to the good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, because it does not bear the sword for nothing; because it is God''s minister, an avenger with a view to wrath on the wrongdoer.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345013005,'Therefore it is necessary to submit, not only because of the wrath, but also because of the conscience.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,345013006,'This is precisely why you pay taxes, for they are God''s servants, continually attending on this very thing.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001009,'God is faithful, by whom you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001010,'Now I appeal to you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be restored to the same mind and to the same purpose.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001011,'You see, my brothers, it has been reported to me concerning you, by some from Chloe''s household, that there are contentions among you.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001013,'Has Christ been divided? It was not Paul who was crucified for you, was it? You were not baptized into the name of Paul, were you?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001014,'I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001017,'Because Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the Gospel—not with eloquent ‘wisdom’, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of power.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001018,'The message of the cross, you see, is foolishness to those who are being wasted, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001020,'Where is the wise one? Where is the scholar? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001021,'For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through its ‘wisdom’ did not get to know God, it pleased God to save the believing ones through the ‘foolishness’ of what was preached—'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001023,'but we proclaim a crucified Christ: an offense to Jews, foolishness to Greeks.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001025,'because the ‘foolishness’ of God is wiser than men, and the ‘weakness’ of God is stronger than men.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001026,'Just look at your calling, brothers: not many are wise, not many are powerful, not many are of noble birth, by human standards;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001027,'but God has chosen the foolish things of the world that He might put the wise to shame, and God has chosen the weak things of the world that He might put the strong things to shame;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346001031,'so that, as it is written: “He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002001,'So when I came to you, brothers, I did not come proclaiming God''s testimony to you with a ‘superior’ speech or wisdom.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002002,'For I determined to ‘know’ nothing while among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002003,'Also, I was with you in weakness, in fear, and with much trembling.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002004,'Yes, my message and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002005,'so that your faith not be in men''s wisdom, but in God''s power.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002006,'However, we do speak wisdom among the mature, albeit not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are being set aside;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002009,'However, as it is written: “Things no eye has seen and no ear has heard, and no heart of man has imagined, such things has God prepared for those who love Him.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002010,'But to us God has revealed them by His Spirit; because the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002011,'Now who among men knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man that is in him? So also no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002012,'We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, so that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002013,'which things we also expound, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Holy Spirit, interpreting spiritual things to spiritual people.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002014,'Now a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; indeed, he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002015,'But he who is spiritual evaluates everything, while not being himself subject to anyone''s judgment.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346002016,'For “who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct Him?” But we have the mind of Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003001,'Brothers, I was not able to address you as spiritual, but as fleshly, as infants in Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003002,'I gave you milk and not solid food, because you were not ready yet. Alas, you are still not ready,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003003,'because you are still fleshly! For since there is envy, strife and divisions among you, are you not carnal and acting like ordinary people?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003004,'For when one says, “I am of Paul,” and another, “I am of Apollos,” are you not carnal?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003005,'Who then is Paul, who is Apollos, but ministers through whom you believed, as the Lord has given to each one?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003006,'I planted, Apollos watered, but God keeps making it grow.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003007,'So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who makes it grow.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003008,'Now he who plants and he who waters are at one, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003009,'Yes, we are God''s coworkers; you are God''s ‘field’, God''s ‘building’.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003010,'According to the grace of God that was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, while another builds on it. But let each one be careful how he builds;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003012,'Now if anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003013,'the work of each will become evident; because the Day will make it clear, because it will be revealed by fire. Yes, the fire will test each one''s work, of what sort it is.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003014,'If the work that anyone built endures, he will receive a reward.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003015,'If anyone''s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, albeit so as through fire.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003016,'Do you (pl) not know that you are a temple of God and the Spirit of God dwells in you?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003017,'If anyone destroys God''s temple, God will destroy him; because God''s temple, which you are, is holy.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003018,'Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become ‘foolish’ so that he may become wise.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003019,'Because the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness”;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003020,'and again, “The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they are futile.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003021,'So then, let no one boast in men, for all things are yours:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003022,'whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, whether the world or life or death, whether things present or things to come—all are yours,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346003023,'and you are Christ''s, and Christ is God''s.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004001,'Let a man consider us like this: as Christ''s subordinates and stewards of God''s mysteries.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004002,'Moreover, what is required of stewards is that each be found faithful.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004003,'So to me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by a human court; in fact, I do not even judge myself.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004004,'For I am conscious of nothing against myself, although I am not justified by this; it is the Lord who judges me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004005,'Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and expose the motives of the hearts. At that time the praise that comes to each will be from God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004006,'I have illustrated these things using myself and Apollos, brothers, for your sakes, so that you may learn from us not to think beyond what is written, that no one of you be puffed up in favor of the one against the other.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004007,'Now who is distinguishing you? Or what do you have that you did not receive? So if you did indeed receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004008,'You are already stuffed! You are already rich! You have become ‘kings’ without us! I could wish that you really did reign, so that we might be kings with you too!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004009,'For I keep thinking that God has displayed us, the apostles, at the end of the line, like men sentenced to death; because we have been made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004010,'We are fools for Christ while you are wise! We are weak but you are strong! You are esteemed, we are despised!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004011,'To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty; we are poorly dressed, brutally treated, and wander homeless;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004012,'yes, we labor, working with our own hands. Upon being reviled, we bless; upon being persecuted, we endure it;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004014,'I am not writing these things to shame you; I am admonishing you as my dear children.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004015,'Because even if you were to have thousands of tutors in Christ, you would not have many fathers, because I am the one who begot you in Christ Jesus, through the Gospel.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004017,'That is why I sent you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful son in Sovereign, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every congregation.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004018,'Now some have been puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004020,'Because the Kingdom of God is not in word but in power.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346004021,'What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a gentle spirit?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346005001,'It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as not even pagans talk about—that someone has his father''s wife!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346005002,'And you are puffed up and not even grieved, so as to exclude the one who has done this deed from your fellowship.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346005003,'For I indeed, as present in spirit though absent in body, have already judged the one who created this situation, as though I were present:'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346005006,'Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346005007,'Therefore purge out the old leaven, so that you can be a new batch, like you are, without yeast. Especially since Christ our Passover has been sacrificed in our place.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346005009,'I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with fornicators—'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346005011,'But now I write you not to associate with anyone who calls himself a brother who is a fornicator, or greedy, or an idolater, or abusive, or a drunkard, or a swindler—not even to eat with such.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346005012,'Now just why should it be up to me to judge those who are outside? Will you not judge those who are inside?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346005013,'Those who are outside God will judge, and you must exclude the wicked one from among you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346006001,'How can anyone of you who has a dispute with another dare to have it judged before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346006002,'Do you not know that the saints are to be judging the world? So if the world is to be judged by you, are you not competent to judge the smallest matters?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346006003,'Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346006004,'Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, appoint those who are least esteemed in the congregation to judge!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346006005,'I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is not a single wise man among you who would be competent to judge between a man and his brother?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346006006,'Instead, brother goes to law against brother, and this before unbelievers!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346006007,'Actually, the very fact that you have lawsuits among you already represents a defeat for you. Why do you not rather accept wrong? Why not rather accept being cheated?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346006008,'No, you yourselves do the wronging and cheating, and to brothers!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346006009,'Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Do not be deceived! Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor catamites, nor sodomites,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346006011,'And that is what some of you were; but you were bathed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346006012,'All things are ‘permissible’ for me, but not all things are expedient. All things are ‘permissible’ for me, but I will not be mastered by anything.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346006013,'Foods for the stomach and the stomach for foods, but God will destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346006015,'Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Not ever!'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346007014,'For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are consecrated.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346007015,'But if the unbeliever separates, let him separate—in such cases the brother or the sister is not enslaved, but God has called us to peace.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346007028,'However, should you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin should marry, she has not sinned. Still, such will have trouble in the flesh, and I want to spare you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346007029,'Now I say this, brothers, the time has been shortened, so that from now on even those who have wives should be as though they had none,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346008003,'But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346008004,'Therefore, concerning the eating of things offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and no one else is God except the One.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346008005,'For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on the earth (since there are many ‘gods’ and many ‘lords’),'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346008009,'But take care lest somehow this ‘right’ of yours become a stumbling block to those who are weak.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346008010,'For if someone who is weak sees you with your knowledge eating in an idol''s temple, will not his conscience be emboldened to eat things offered to idols?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346008011,'And so the weak brother, for whom Christ died, will be wasted because of your knowledge.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346008012,'But when you thus sin against the brothers and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346011019,'For there would really need to be factions among you so that the ‘approved’ ones may be recognized among you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346011020,'So when you come together in one place, it is not to eat the Lord''s Supper.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346011021,'Because in eating, each one tries to get his meal first, and one goes hungry while another gets drunk!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346011022,'Now really, do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise God''s congregation, and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? Indeed not!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346011023,'For I received from the Lord that which I also transmitted to you: The Lord Jesus, during the night in which He was betrayed, took bread;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346011028,'But let a man examine himself, and then let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346011029,'Because he who eats and drinks unworthily eats and drinks judgment to himself, not distinguishing the Lord''s body.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346011030,'Because of this many among you are weak and sick, and a good many have died.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346011031,'If we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346011034,'But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together into judgment. And the rest I will set in order when I come.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012001,'Now concerning the spiritual things, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012002,'You know that when you were pagans you were always led toward the mute idols, being carried away.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012003,'Therefore I inform you that no one speaking by God''s Spirit calls Jesus accursed, and no one can declare Jesus to be Lord except by the Holy Spirit.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012004,'Now there are allotments of spiritual gifts, but the same Spirit.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012005,'And there are allotments of ministries, and the same Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012006,'And there are allotments of activities, but the same God is He who works them all, in all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012007,'But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the common good.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012008,'So to one a word of wisdom is given, by the Spirit; to another a word of knowledge, by the same Spirit;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012009,'to a different one faith, by the same Spirit; to another presents of healings, by the same Spirit;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012012,'Now just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of that one body, though being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012013,'For we also were all baptized into one body by one Spirit—whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free—and were all given to drink into one Spirit.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012014,'For in fact the body is not one part but many.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012015,'If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body,” it would not therefore cease to be of the body.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012016,'And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body,” it would not therefore cease to be of the body.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012017,'If the whole body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012018,'But God has really placed the members in the body, each one of them, just as He pleased.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012019,'(If the whole were just one member, where would the body be?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012020,'But in fact the parts are many but the body one.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012021,'Further, the eye cannot say to the hand, “I do not need you”; nor again the head to the feet, “I do not need you.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012022,'Much to the contrary, those members of the body that seem to be weaker are necessary.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012023,'And the parts of the body that we consider to be less honorable, on these we bestow greater honor; and our unpresentables have special modesty,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012024,'while our presentables do not need it. Yes, God has blended the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacks it,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012025,'so that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012026,'and if one member suffers, all the members should suffer along, or if one member is honored, all the members should rejoice along.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012027,'Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346012028,'And those whom God has appointed in the Church are: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; after that miracles, then presents of healings, helps, administrations, kinds of languages.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346013004,'Love is patient and kind; love does not envy; love does not brag, is not proud,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346013005,'is not indecent, is not self-seeking, is not ‘short-fused’, is not malicious;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346013006,'it does not take pleasure in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346013007,'it bears all, believes all, hopes all, endures all;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346013008,'love never fails. Now as for prophecies, they will be set aside; as for languages, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will be superseded;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346013009,'since we know in part and prophesy in part.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346013010,'But whenever the complete should come, then the ‘in part’ will be done away with.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346013013,'For now these three obtain: faith, hope, love; and the greatest of these is love.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014001,'Pursue love, and desire the spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014002,'Because he who speaks in a ‘language’ is not speaking to people but to God, since no one understands; in spirit he speaks mysteries.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014005,'I could wish that you all spoke in ‘languages’, but even more that you might prophesy; because the one prophesying is greater than the one speaking in ‘languages’ (unless he interprets), so that the congregation may receive edification.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014006,'Now then, brothers, what good will I do you if I come to you speaking in ‘languages’ instead of addressing you with revelation, or with knowledge, or with prophecy, or with teaching?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014007,'Take lifeless things like a flute or a harp; if they make no distinction in the notes when they produce sound, how will it be known what is being piped or harped?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014008,'Also a trumpet; if it gives an indistinct sound, who will prepare for battle?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014009,'So it is with you: if you do not deliver an intelligible message with the ‘language’, how will it be known what is being said? You will just be speaking into the air.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014010,'There are probably a great many kinds of sounds in the world, and none of them is without significance.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014011,'But if I do not know the force of the sound, I will be a foreigner to the speaker, and he will be a foreigner to me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014012,'And you too: since you are zealous for spiritual things, aim at the edification of the congregation, that you may all grow.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014013,'Therefore the one speaking in a ‘language’ should pray that he may interpret.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014014,'For if I pray in a ‘language’, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014015,'So what then? I will pray with the spirit, but I will also pray with the mind; I will sing with the spirit, but I will also sing with the mind.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014016,'Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how will he who occupies the place of the outsider say the “Amen” at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014017,'You, of course, give thanks quite well, but the other is not edified.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014018,'I thank my God speaking in ‘languages’ more than you all,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014019,'but in the congregation I would rather speak five words with my understanding, precisely so as to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a ‘language’.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014020,'Brothers, stop thinking like children—well, in malice be ‘infants’, but in thinking be adults.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014021,'In the law it stands written: “I will speak to this people in foreign languages and with different ‘lips’, but not even then will they listen to me,” says the Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014022,'Therefore the ‘languages’ are for a sign, not to believers but to unbelievers; while prophesying is not for unbelievers but for believers.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014023,'So if the whole congregation comes together and all are speaking in ‘languages’, but outsiders or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are raving?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014024,'But if everyone is prophesying, and an unbeliever or outsider comes in, he is reproved by all, he is examined by all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014025,'And thus the secrets of his heart are exposed, and so, falling on his face he will worship God, affirming, “Truly God is among you!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014026,'So what goes on, brothers? Whenever you come together, each of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a ‘language’, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014027,'If anyone speaks in a ‘language’, let it be two—at the most three—and in turn, and let one interpret.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014028,'But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in church; let him speak to himself and to God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014029,'Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others evaluate.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014030,'But if another who is sitting by receives a revelation, the first should stop speaking.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014031,'For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all may be encouraged.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014032,'Yes, spirits of prophets are subordinate to prophets.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014033,'Further, God is not a God of disorder but of peace. As in all the congregations of the saints,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014034,'your wives should keep silent in the assemblies, for they are not permitted to speak, but to be in subordination, as the law also says.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014035,'If they want to learn about something, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for women to speak in church.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014036,'Or was it from you that the Word of God went forth? Or was it only to you that it came?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014037,'If anyone thinks that he is a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things I write to you are the Lord''s commands.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014038,'But if anyone is ignorant, let him remain so.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014039,'So then, brothers, seek to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak in ‘languages’.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346014040,'Let all things be done properly and in order.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015001,'Now, brothers, I want to add information to the Gospel that I proclaimed to you, that you also received, and in which you stand;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015002,'through which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word that I proclaimed to you—unless you believed in vain.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015003,'Because I transmitted to you at first that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015004,'and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015005,'and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the Twelve.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015006,'After that He was seen by over five hundred brothers at once, most of whom are still living, while some have fallen asleep.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015007,'After that He was seen by James, then by all the apostles.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015008,'And last of all He was seen by me also, like one born out of season.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015009,'For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015010,'But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me has not been in vain; in fact, I have worked harder than all of them—well, not I, but the grace of God that was with me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015011,'So whether it was I or they, thus we preached and thus you believed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015012,'Now if Christ is being proclaimed as having been raised from among the dead, how can some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015013,'If there is no resurrection of the dead, not even Christ has been raised.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015014,'And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is empty, and so is your faith!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015015,'Further, we are even discovered to be false witnesses of God, because we have testified about God that He raised the Christ, whom He did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015016,'For if no dead are raised, neither has Christ been raised.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015017,'And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is useless; you are still in your sins.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015018,'Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015019,'If it is only for this life that we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most pitiable.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015020,'But indeed, Christ has been raised from the dead; He became the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015021,'For since death came through a man, resurrection of the dead also came through a man.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015022,'For as all in Adam are dying, so also all in the Christ will be made alive.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015023,'But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then those who belong to Christ at His coming;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015024,'then the end, when He hands over the Kingdom to the God and Father, whenever He puts an end to every ruler and all authority and power.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015025,'Because it is necessary that He reign until He has put all the enemies under His feet.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015026,'The last enemy that will be destroyed is death.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015027,'For “He has put all things under His feet.” But when it says that all things have been subordinated, it is obvious that He who put all things under Him is excepted.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015028,'Now whenever all things have been subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subjected to Him who subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all in all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015029,'Otherwise, what will they do who are being baptized in place of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, just why are they being baptized in the place of the dead?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015030,'And why do we face danger every hour?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015031,'I die every day—so I affirm by the boasting about you that I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015032,'If I fought human ‘animals’ in Ephesus, what did I gain? If the dead are not raised, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015033,'Stop kidding yourselves: evil associations corrupt good habits.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015034,'Sober up righteously, and stop sinning, for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015035,'But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015036,'Ignorant, what you plant is not brought to life unless it dies.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015037,'And what you plant is a bare seed (perhaps of wheat or some one of the others); you do not plant the body that it will become.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015038,'But God gives it a body just as He determined, to each of the seeds its own body.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015039,'All flesh is not the same flesh: that of humans is one kind, and the flesh of animals is another, that of fish is another, that of birds is yet another.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015040,'There are also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the heavenly is one, while that of the earthly is another.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015041,'There is one splendor of the sun, another splendor of the moon, and another splendor of the stars; and star differs from star in brightness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015042,'The resurrection of the dead is like that: the body is ‘planted’ in deterioration and it is raised in incorruptibility;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015043,'it is ‘planted’ in dishonor and it is raised in glory; it is ‘planted’ in weakness and it is raised in power;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015044,'it is ‘planted’ a natural body and it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015045,'So also it is written: “The first man, Adam, became a living being”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015046,'However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and then the spiritual.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015047,'The first man was of the earth, of soil; the second man was the Lord from heaven.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015048,'As was the earth-man, just so are the earth-people; and as was the heaven-man, just so are the heaven-people.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015049,'And just as we have borne the image of the earth-man, we should also bear the image of the heaven-man.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015050,'Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God; neither will deterioration inherit incorruptibility.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015051,'And now, I tell you a mystery: we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015052,'—in a split second, in an eye twinkle, at the last trumpet—the trumpet will blast and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015053,'Because this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal put on immortality.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015054,'So whenever this corruptible puts on incorruption and this mortal puts on immortality, then this written word will happen: “Death has been swallowed down into victory.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015055,'“Where, O Death, is your sting? Where, O Hades, is your victory?”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015056,'The stinger of death is sin, and the adjunct of sin is the law.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015057,'Now thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346015058,'So then, my dear brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016001,'Now concerning the collection for the saints, you must do just as I instructed the congregations in Galatia.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016002,'On the first day of the week, each of you should set something aside, saving up as he is being prospered, that there be no collections when I come.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016003,'And when I arrive, I will send whomever you approve by letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016004,'But should it be fitting that I go as well, they will go with me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016005,'Now I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia (for I am coming through Macedonia).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016006,'And perhaps I will stay with you awhile, or even winter, that you may send me on my way, wherever I go.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016007,'I do not wish to see you now just in passing, since I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016008,'So I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016009,'because a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016010,'Now if Timothy should come, see to it that he may be with you without fear, because he does the Lord''s work just as I do.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016011,'Therefore no one should despise him; but send him on his way in peace, that he may come to me; I am expecting him along with the brothers.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016012,'Now about brother Apollos: I repeatedly urged him to go to you with the brothers, but he just did not want to go at this time; he will go whenever he has an opportunity.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016013,'Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous! Be strong!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016014,'Do all you do in love.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016015,'Now brothers, you know that the household of Stephanas is the firstfruits of Achaia and that they have really devoted themselves to ministering to the saints,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016016,'so I urge you to submit to such people, to all the fellow-workers and laborers.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016017,'I am glad about the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus, for what was lacking on your part they have supplied;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016018,'for they refreshed my spirit and yours; so give recognition to such men.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016019,'The congregations of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla, with the congregation in their house, greet you warmly in the Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016020,'All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016021,'I, Paul, personally sign this greeting.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016022,'If anyone does not love our Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. The Lord is coming!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016023,'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,346016024,'My love is with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001001,'Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and brother Timothy, to the church of God that is in Corinth, together with all the saints throughout Achaia:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001002,'Grace and peace to you from God our Father and Sovereign Jesus Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001003,'All praise to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and God of all encouragement,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001004,'who encourages us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to encourage those who are in whatever affliction, by means of the encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged by God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001005,'Because just as the sufferings of the Christ flow over into us, so also our encouraging overflows, through Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001006,'Now then, if we are afflicted, it is for the sake of your encouragement and deliverance, that are effective for enduring the same sufferings that we also are suffering'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001007,'(yes, our hope concerning you is steadfast); if we are encouraged, it also is for the sake of your encouragement and deliverance, since we know that you will share in the encouragement just as you do in the sufferings.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001008,'And so, brothers, we do not want you to be in ignorance concerning the affliction that came upon us in Asia: we were under extreme pressure, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001009,'Yes, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, so that we not place confidence in ourselves, but in the God who raises the dead;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001010,'He did deliver us from that deadly peril, and still delivers; in whom we trust that He will keep on delivering,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001011,'you also adding your cooperation in prayer, on our behalf; that thanks may be given by many persons for the gift bestowed on us by means of many, on your behalf.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001012,'Now this is our boast: the testimony of our conscience that we have conducted ourselves in the world with openness and godly sincerity, not by fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God, and especially toward you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001013,'For we do not write you any other things than what you can read and understand; and I do hope that you will keep on understanding to the end'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001014,'(as indeed some of you have acknowledged) that we are your boast, just as you are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001015,'It was in this confidence that I was planning to come by you first,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001016,'and by you to proceed into Macedonia, and to come back to you from Macedonia (that you might benefit twice), and then to be sent by you on my way to Judea.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001017,'Now then, when I was deciding this, I was not acting frivolously, was I? Or the things I decide, do I decide according to the flesh, so that with me there would be both “Yes, yes” and “No, no”?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001018,'As God is faithful, our word to you was not “Yes” and “No”,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001019,'because the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was proclaimed among you by us—by me and Silvanus and Timothy—was not “Yes” and “No”. In fact, with Him it has always been “Yes”,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001020,'because all the promises of God in Him are “Yes”; indeed, in Him they are “Amen”, that there be glory to God through us.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001021,'Now He who establishes us together with you into Christ, and who anointed us, is God,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001022,'who also sealed us and gave us the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001023,'For my part, I call on God as witness, upon my soul, that it was to spare you that I have not yet returned to Corinth.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347001024,'(Not that we have control over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, for it is by faith that you stand firm.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002001,'Actually, I determined this within myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002002,'For if I make you sorrowful, then who will make me glad, besides the one whom I made sorrowful?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002003,'And I wrote this very thing to you so as not to have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice, when I come, having confidence in you all that my joy is also yours.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002004,'Now I wrote to you out of great distress and anguish of heart, with many tears, not that you should be made sorrowful, but that you might know the greatness of my love for you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002005,'So, if anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has all of you, to some extent—not to be too ‘heavy’.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002006,'This punishment that was inflicted by the majority is sufficient to such a one,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002007,'so that now, on the other side, you should forgive and comfort him, so that he not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002008,'Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love to him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002009,'Now I also wrote to this end: to put you to the test, to see whether you are obedient in all things.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002010,'If you forgive anyone, I do too; further, if indeed I have forgiven anything to someone, I have done so for your sakes in the presence of Christ,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002011,'so that we not be exploited by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his intentions.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002012,'Also, upon arriving in Troas for the Gospel of Christ, a door having been opened to me by Sovereign,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002013,'I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; so taking leave of them I went on into Macedonia.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002014,'Now thanks be to the God who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of Him in every place.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002015,'Because we are the aroma of Christ for God, among those who are being saved and among those who are being wasted—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002016,'to these a smell of death into death, while to those a fragrance of life into life—and who is adequate for such things?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347002017,'However, we are not like the rest who retail the word of God; rather, we speak in Christ, out of sincerity, as of God in His very presence.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003001,'(Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you, or commendation from you?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003002,'You are our letter, inscribed on our hearts, known and read by all men;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003003,'you are manifestly a letter of Christ, mediated by us, written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not on stone tablets but on ‘tablets’ that are hearts of flesh.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003004,'Now we have such confidence before God because of the Christ;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003005,'not that we are competent of ourselves to reckon anything as being from ourselves, but our competence is from God—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003006,'indeed, He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant; not of letter but of Spirit, because the letter kills, while the Spirit gives life.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003007,'Now if the ministry of death, engraved in letters on stones, came with glory—so that the children of Israel could not gaze at the face of Moses because of the glory of his countenance (that was fading)—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003008,'how can the ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003009,'For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, how much more glorious is the ministry of righteousness!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003010,'Because what had glory could actually be said to be without glory, compared to the surpassing glory—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003011,'if what is being set aside had glory, that which is continuing is much more glorious.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003012,'Therefore, since we have such a hope, we use great boldness of speech—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003013,'not like Moses, who put a veil over his own face, so that the children of Israel would not observe the end of what was fading.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003014,'But, it was their minds that were closed, because to this day that very veil remains in place when the Old Testament is read, since only in Christ is it taken away.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003015,'Yes, even to this day, when Moses is read a veil lies on their heart.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003016,'However, whenever anyone turns to the Lord the veil is removed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003017,'Now the Spirit is the Lord, and where the Lord''s Spirit is there is freedom.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347003018,'So we all, contemplating as in a mirror the glory of the Lord with unveiled face, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, precisely from Lord Spirit.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004001,'Therefore, since we have received mercy along with this ministry, we do not lose heart.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004002,'Rather, we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in deception nor falsifying the Word of God, but by the open proclamation of the Truth commending ourselves to every man''s conscience, in the sight of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004003,'So where our Gospel has actually been concealed, it has been hidden from those who are being wasted,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004004,'among whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, so that the light of the Gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn on them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004005,'Now we do not proclaim ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Sovereign, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus'' sake;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004006,'because the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness is He who shined in our hearts to give the light that comes from the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004007,'Further, we have this treasure in jars of clay, so that this all-surpassing power may be of God and not from ourselves'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004008,'—we are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004009,'persecuted, yet not abandoned; knocked down, but not out;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004010,'always carrying about in the body the putting to death of the Lord Jesus, so that also the life of Jesus may be manifested in our body.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004011,'For we, the living, are always being handed over to death for Jesus'' sake, so that also the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004012,'So then, death is at work in us, but life in you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004013,'Now since we have the same spirit of faith, just like it is written, “I believed; therefore I spoke,” we also believe and therefore speak,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004014,'knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us through Jesus and present us together with you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004015,'So all this is for your benefit, so that the grace that has spread through the many may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004016,'Therefore we do not lose heart—even though our outer man is wasting away, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004017,'because our light, momentary affliction is working out for us an eternal and limitless measure of glory,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347004018,'as we do not focus on the seen, but on the not seen; for what is seen is transitory, but what is unseen is eternal.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005001,'Now then, we know that though our earthly, tent-like ‘house’ may be destroyed, we have a building from God (not a handmade house), eternal in the heavens.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005002,'Further, in this one we do groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly habitation;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005003,'since, obviously, once clothed we will not be found naked.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005004,'Yes, being in this ‘tent’ is a burden, so we groan—not enough to want to strip, but to be really clothed; that what is mortal may be swallowed up by the Life.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005005,'Now it is God who has prepared us for this very purpose, who also has given us the down payment of the Spirit.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005006,'So we are always confident, even knowing that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord''s home'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005007,'—we walk by faith, not by sight—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005008,'indeed, we are confident in preferring to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005009,'Yes, that is why we make it our aim (whether at home or away from it) to be well pleasing to Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005010,'Because we must all be exposed before Christ''s Judgment Seat, that each one may receive his due for the things he did while in the body, whether good or bad.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005011,'Therefore, since we know the Lord''s intimidation, we try to convince people. We are well known to God, and I hope in your consciences as well.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005012,'We are not commending ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity of boasting on our behalf, that you may have an answer for those who boast in appearance and not in heart.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005013,'If we are ‘out of our senses’, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005014,'For Christ''s love impels us, having concluded this: if One died for all it follows that all died;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005015,'and He died for all so that those who now live should no longer live for themselves but for the One who died for all and was raised again.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005016,'So then, from now on we regard no one from a fleshly perspective—even if we have ‘known’ Christ in this way, we do so no longer—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005017,'so then, if anyone is in Christ he is a new creation; the old things have passed on; look, all has become new!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005018,'And that ‘all’ is from the God who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ and given us the ministry of the reconciliation,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005019,'namely that in Christ God was reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, including committing to us the message of this reconciliation.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005020,'So then, we are Christ''s ambassadors, as though God were making His appeal through us. We implore you on Christ''s behalf: Be reconciled to God!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347005021,'Because He made the One who did not know sin to be sin on our behalf, so that in Him we might become God''s righteousness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006001,'So working together we really urge you not to receive God''s grace in vain,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006002,'for He says: “At a favorable time I listened to you, and in a day of salvation I aided you.” Well, right now is a really favorable time; indeed, the day of salvation is now!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006003,'(We give no occasion for offense in anything, that the ministry not be faulted;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006004,'rather we commend ourselves as God''s servants in every way with great endurance—in afflictions, in hardships, in distress,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006005,'in beatings, in imprisonments, in tumults, in hard work, in sleepless nights, in fastings;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006006,'by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006007,'by truthful speech, by God''s power, with the weapons of the righteousness in the right hand and in the left;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006008,'through glory and dishonor, through defamation and good repute; as ‘deceivers’ and true,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006009,'as unknown and well known, as dying and we live on, as chastened and not killed;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006010,'as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing and yet possessing everything!)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006011,'O Corinthians! We have spoken openly to you, our heart is open wide.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006012,'You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your affections.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006013,'Now in return for the same (I speak as to my children), you also be wide open.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006014,'Do not enter a mismatch with unbelievers; for what do righteousness and lawlessness have in common? And what fellowship does light have with darkness?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006015,'And what agreement is there between Christ and Belial? Or what portion can a believer share with an unbeliever?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006016,'Further, what agreement can a temple of God have with idols? Because you are a temple of the living God, just as God said: “I will dwell in them and walk among them; I will be their God and they will by my people.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006017,'Therefore, “Come out from among them and be separate,” says the Lord, “Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347006018,'And, “I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to me, says the Lord Almighty.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007001,'Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007002,'Make room for us; we have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have exploited no one.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007003,'I do not say this to condemn you; I have said before that you are in our hearts, whether to die together or to live together.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007004,'I have great confidence in you; I do a lot of boasting about you. I am filled with encouragement, overflowing with joy in spite of all our affliction.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007005,'Now indeed, when we came into Macedonia we had no physical rest, but were surrounded by affliction—conflicts on the outside, fears on the inside.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007006,'But the God who encourages the lowly encouraged us by the coming of Titus;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007007,'and not only by his coming, but also by how much he was encouraged over you as he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your zeal in my stead, so that I rejoiced even more.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007008,'Even though that letter caused you sorrow, I do not regret it (though I almost did), because I perceive that the letter made you sorry, though only for a while.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007009,'Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that your sorrow led to repentance. For you were made sorry as God intended, so as not to be harmed by us in any way.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007010,'Now godly sorrow produces repentance into salvation without regret, but the world''s sorrow produces death.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007011,'Just consider your own being caused to sorrow in a godly manner, how much diligence it produced in you—what self-defense, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what zeal, what punishment! At every point you have demonstrated yourselves to be clear in the matter.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007012,'So even though I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of the wrongdoer, nor for that of the victim, but, before God, so that your real commitment to us might be made clear to you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007013,'We have been encouraged by all this. Because of your encouragement, we rejoiced all the more over the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007014,'Because wherein I boasted to him about you, I was not put to shame, but just as everything we spoke to you was true, so also our boasting to Titus proved to be true.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007015,'Also, his affection for you is all the greater, as he remembers your collective obedience as you received him with fear and trembling.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347007016,'I am so glad that I have complete confidence in you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008001,'And now, brothers, we want you to know about the grace of God that has been bestowed upon the congregations of Macedonia,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008002,'that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their extreme poverty produced their extravagant, sincere generosity.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008003,'Because according to their ability, I bear witness, even beyond that ability, of their own accord,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008004,'they begged us with much entreaty to receive the gift, the sharing in the ministry to the saints'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008005,'—and more than we had hoped, they first gave themselves to the Lord (and due to God''s will, to us).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008006,'So we urged Titus that as he had made a beginning so he should also bring to completion in you this grace as well;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008007,'that as you excel in everything—in faith, in word, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us—that you excel in this grace too.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008008,'I am not giving a command, but I am testing the sincerity of your love by the diligence of others.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008009,'For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for our sakes He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008010,'So here is my advice in this (since already a year ago you began to give and to plan, this is to your advantage):'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008011,'now you must really finish the doing—not only of the enthusiastic planning but also of the completing—out of what you have'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008012,'(because when the intention is presented, it is acceptable according to what one may have, not what he does not have).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008013,'Now this is not to distress you so as to relieve others,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008014,'but by way of balance—at this juncture your surplus alleviates their lack, so that later their surplus may alleviate your lack—yes, that there be balance;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008015,'as it is written: “He who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008016,'Now thanks be to God who puts the same earnest care for you in the heart of Titus;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008017,'because he not only welcomed my appeal but being very diligent he went to you of his own accord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008018,'But we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the Gospel is throughout all the congregations;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008019,'and not only that—he was actually chosen by the congregations as our traveling companion with this gift, that is being administered by us with a view to the glory of the Lord Himself, and to our own goodwill,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008020,'avoiding any criticism about how we are handling this abundance;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008021,'giving thought to blamelessness, not only before the Lord but also before men.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008022,'Further, we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved to be diligent in many things, but now much more so, because of our great confidence in you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008023,'As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker toward you; as for our brothers, they are envoys of the congregations, a glory of Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347008024,'Therefore show the proof of your love (and of our boasting about you) to them as representatives of the congregations.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009001,'Now concerning the ministry to the saints, it is unnecessary for me to write to you;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009002,'for I know your readiness, about which I boast of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia has been ready since last year, and your zeal has stirred up the majority.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009003,'Still, I have sent the brothers so that our boasting about you in this matter not prove to be empty, so that you may be ready, like I said'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009004,'—if any Macedonians were to go with me and find you unprepared, we (not to mention, you!) would be put to shame by this confident boasting.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009005,'So I considered it necessary to urge the brothers to go to you in advance and finish preparing the ‘blessing’ you had promised, that it be ready, representing generosity and not stinginess.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009006,'Now then, whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009007,'Each one should give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion; for God loves a glad giver.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009008,'Further, God is able to make all ‘grace’ abound toward you, that always having all sufficiency in everything you may abound to every good work—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009009,'as it is written: “He has distributed around, he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever”—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009010,'yes, the One who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, so as to supply and multiply your seed for sowing and to increase the yield of your righteousness;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009011,'you being enriched in everything so as to always be generous, which passing through us produces thanksgiving to God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009012,'Because the administration of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009013,'—on the basis of the proof that this service gives, they are glorifying God for the obedience of your confession into the Gospel of Christ, and for the generosity of your sharing with them and everybody—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009014,'and in their prayer for you, longing for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347009015,'Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010001,'Now I, Paul, am myself appealing to you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ (I who am ‘humble when present’ among you, but ‘bold when absent’ toward you).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010002,'Yes, I beg you, that when I am present I may not have to be bold with the confidence that I will ‘dare’ to visit upon some who think that we are walking in a fleshly manner.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010003,'Well, we do walk about in flesh, but we do not wage war that way,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010004,'because the weapons of our warfare are not physical, but are powerful in God for demolishing strongholds:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010005,'demolishing sophistries and every arrogance that sets itself up against the knowledge of God; taking captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010006,'being ready to punish every act of disobedience, whenever your obedience is complete.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010007,'Do you only look at the ‘face’ of things? If anyone has persuaded himself that he is Christ''s, let him consider this again with himself, that just as he is Christ''s, so also we are Christ''s.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010008,'Now even if I boast a little to excess about our authority (which the Lord gave us for building up, not to tear you down), I will not act ashamed,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010009,'so as not to appear to agree that it is only with letters that I ‘terrify’ you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010010,'Because some say, “His letters are ‘heavy’ and forceful, but his physical presence is weak, and his speech can be disdained.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010011,'Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters while absent is just what we will be in action when present.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010012,'Now we do not dare to class or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves; but they, measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010013,'We, however, will not boast beyond proper limits, but will stay within the boundaries that God assigned to us, a field that includes you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010014,'For we are not overextending ourselves, as though we had not reached you, because we did indeed get to you with the Gospel of Christ;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010015,'nor do we boast ‘off limits’ in the labors of others, but we have hope that as your faith grows our boundaries will be greatly expanded through you,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010016,'so as to evangelize the regions beyond you (not to boast in work already done in someone else''s field).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010017,'“He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347010018,'Because it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but whom the Lord commends.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011001,'I could wish that you would put up with a little of my foolishness, but indeed you already are.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011002,'For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy, because I betrothed you to one man to present you to Christ as a pure virgin.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011003,'But I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve with his cunning, so your minds may be corrupted from the integrity that is in Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011004,'For if someone comes and preaches another ‘Jesus’ whom we did not preach, or you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you easily put up with it.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011005,'Now I consider that I am not at all inferior to the very best apostles.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011006,'Though I may not be a trained speaker, I do have knowledge—but we have been fully manifested to you in all things.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011007,'Or did I commit a sin in humbling self so that you might be exalted, in that I proclaimed God''s Gospel to you free of charge?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011008,'I ‘robbed’ other congregations, receiving support from them so as to serve you,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011009,'and when I was with you and in need, I did not burden anyone; because the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my need. Yes, I kept myself from being a burden to you in anything, and will keep on.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011010,'The truth of Christ is in me: this boasting will not be silenced in me in the regions of Achaia.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011011,'Why? Because I do not love you? God knows!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011012,'Further, I will keep on doing what I do in order to cut off the opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things of which they boast.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011013,'Such men are really false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into ‘apostles’ of Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011014,'And no wonder, because Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011015,'So it is no great thing if his servants also masquerade as ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011016,'Again I say, let no one think me a fool. But should anyone do so, at least receive me as a fool, that I also may boast a little bit.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011017,'What I am going to say I do not say according to the Lord, but as though foolishly, in this confident boasting.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011018,'Since many are boasting according to the flesh, I will too'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011019,'(for you put up with fools gladly, being so wise yourselves!).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011020,'In fact, you even put up with someone who enslaves you, who ‘devours’ you, who takes advantage, who exalts himself, who beats on your face!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011021,'Is it disrespectful to say that we were ‘weak’? In whatever anyone is bold (I speak foolishly), I am bold also.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011022,'Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011023,'Are they ministers of Christ? (I''m being irrational) I am more: in labors more abundantly, in beatings beyond count, in prison more frequently, in ‘deaths’ often—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011024,'five times from the Jews I received the ‘forty lashes minus one’;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011025,'three times I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned; three times I was shipwrecked (I spent twenty-four hours in the open sea)—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011026,'in frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, in danger from robbers, in danger from my countrymen, in danger from Gentiles, in danger in cities, in danger in wildernesses, in danger in the sea, in danger among false brothers;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011027,'in toil and hardship, in many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, in frequent fastings, in cold and nakedness—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011028,'quite apart from the other things, my daily disturbances, my concern for all the congregations.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011029,'Who is weak, and I do not feel it? Who is caused to stumble, and I do not burn with indignation?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011030,'Well, if I must boast, I will boast of the things that concern my weakness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011031,'The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011032,'In Damascus the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of the Damascenes, wanting to arrest me;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347011033,'but I was lowered in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped from his hands.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347012001,'It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast; still, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347012002,'I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven—whether in the body or outside of it, I do not know, God knows.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347012003,'Yes, I know such a man—whether in the body or outside of it, I do not know, God knows—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347012004,'how he was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible things, things that a man is not permitted to tell.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347012005,'I can boast about someone like that, but not about myself, unless it be my weakness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347012006,'Now even if I wanted to go on boasting, I would not be stupid but speak the truth; but I refrain, so that no one will think more of me than what he sees in me and hears from me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347012007,'Because of the incredible importance of the revelations, to keep me from feeling too important, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to beat on me—to keep me from feeling too important.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347012008,'Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347012009,'But He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more cheerfully about my weaknesses, so that Christ''s power may take up residence upon me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347012010,'So then, I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ''s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347012011,'I have been boasting foolishly, but you drove me to it. I ought to have been commended by you, because in nothing have I been inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347012012,'Truly the apostolic signs were produced among you with all perseverance, by signs and wonders and miracles.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347012013,'Now in just what were you treated as inferior, compared to the other congregations, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347012014,'Well now, I am ready to come to you a third time, and I will still not burden you, because I want you, not your things—children should not have to save up for parents, but parents for children.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,347012015,'So I will gladly spend and be spent for the sake of your souls, even if the more I love you the less I am loved.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348001011,'Now I want you to know, brothers, that the Gospel preached by me is not according to man;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348001012,'because I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather it came through a revelation from Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348001013,'You have heard of my former conduct while in Judaism, how I was rabid in my persecution of God''s Church and tried to annihilate it;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348001021,'Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348001022,'So I remained unknown by face to the congregations of Judea (those in Christ)'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348002003,'However, not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, for being a Greek.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348002006,'Now from those who seemed to be important (whatever they were makes no difference to me; God shows favoritism to no man)—those with influence contributed nothing to me,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348002007,'but on the contrary, upon seeing that I had been entrusted with the Gospel for the uncircumcised, just as was Peter for the circumcised'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348002008,'(for He who was at work with Peter for the apostleship to the circumcised was also at work with me for that to the uncircumcised),'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348002009,'and upon perceiving the grace that had been given to me, James and Cephas and John, those reputed to be pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, while they to the Jews.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348002010,'They did ask us to keep remembering the poor, the very thing I also was eager to do.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348002011,'But, when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was blameworthy.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348002012,'Before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came he began to draw back and separate himself, fearing those of the circumcision party.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348002015,'We natural Jews (and not ‘Gentile sinners’),'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348002016,'knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, we ourselves have believed into Christ Jesus, so as to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law; because no one will be justified by works of law.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348002018,'“Now if I rebuild the things that I destroyed, I acknowledge that I am a transgressor.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003002,'Just tell me one thing: Did you receive the Spirit by works of law, or by hearing of faith?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003003,'Can you be so foolish? Having begun in spirit, do you finish in flesh?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003004,'Have you suffered so much for nothing—if it really was for nothing?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003005,'Furthermore, He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you, is He activated by works of law, or by hearing of faith?—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003006,'just as Abraham ‘believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003007,'Now you must know that only those who are of faith are ‘sons’ of Abraham.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003008,'Further, the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations by faith, proclaimed the Gospel in advance to Abraham: “All the nations will be blessed through you.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003009,'So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the faithful.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003010,'Now as many as are ‘by works of law’ are under a curse; because it stands written, “Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all the things written in the Book of the Law, to do them.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003011,'Further, it is evident that no one is justified by law before God, because “the righteous one will live by faith.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003012,'While the law is not of faith but, “the man who does them will live by them.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003013,'Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse in our place—because it stands written, “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree”—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003014,'so that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations/Gentiles through Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through the faith.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003015,'Brothers: as a man I speak a covenant; though only of a man, once it has been ratified no one annuls or adds to it.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003016,'But to Abraham were spoken the promises, and to his Seed. He does not say “and to seeds,” as about many, but “and to your seed,” as about one, who is Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003017,'Further, I say this: a covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ cannot be annulled by the law that came four hundred and thirty years later, so as to make the promise of no effect.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003018,'For if the inheritance were of law, it would no longer be of promise, but God granted it to Abraham by promise.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003019,'Why then the law? It was added on account of the transgressions, until the Seed should come to whom the inheritance had been promised; and it was ordered through angels by the hand of a mediator.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003020,'(Now that mediator is not for just one, but God is one.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003021,'Is the law then against the promises of God? Of course not! Rather, if a law had been given that was capable of imparting life, truly righteousness would have been by the law.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003022,'But the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003023,'Now before this faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, in confinement until the coming faith was revealed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003024,'So then, the law became our guardian until Christ, so that we might be justified by faith.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003025,'Now that the faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003026,'So all of you are sons of God through the faith in Christ Jesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003027,'As many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003028,'—there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no ‘male and female’; all of you are one in Christ Jesus—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348003029,'so if you are Christ''s, then you are Abraham''s seed and heirs according to the promise.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004001,'To proceed, as long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, though he is owner of all,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004002,'but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004003,'Similarly, when we were children we were in slavery under the basic principles of the world.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004004,'But at just the right time God sent out His Son, born of a woman, born under law,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004005,'so that He might redeem those under law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004006,'And because you are sons, God sent out the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, calling, “Abba, Father”.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004007,'Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004008,'But at one time indeed, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those that by nature are not gods.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004009,'But now that you know God—better, are known by God—how can you turn back to those weak, yes decidedly inferior, basic principles, to which you wish to be enslaved all over again?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004010,'You are observing days and months and seasons and years.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004011,'I fear for you, lest somehow I have labored over you in vain.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004012,'Brothers, I plead with you, become as I am, for I became like you. You did me no wrong.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004013,'Rather, you know that I preached the Gospel to you the first time in spite of a physical infirmity.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004014,'Also, you did not despise or recoil at my physical trial, but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004015,'So what about your blessedness? Because I can testify that if it were possible you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004016,'Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004017,'They zealously court you—not for good but intending to isolate you, so that you may seek them.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004018,'Now it is good to be zealous in a good thing at any time, and not only when I am present with you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004019,'My little children, for whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004020,'—I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone; because I am perplexed about you!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004021,'Tell me, you who desire to be under law, do you not heed that law?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004022,'For it is written that Abraham had two sons: one by the slave woman and one by the free woman.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004023,'However, the one by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, while the one by the free woman was through the promise.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004024,'I will now allegorize them—these are two covenants: one is from Mount Sinai, bearing children into slavery, which is ‘Hagar’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004025,'(for this ‘Hagar’ is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present day Jerusalem, and is in slavery with her children);'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004026,'while the ‘Jerusalem’ that is above is free, which is the mother of us all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004027,'For it is written: “Rejoice, barren one, who does not give birth; break forth and shout, you who have no labor pains; because the abandoned woman has many more children than she who has the husband.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004028,'Now we, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004029,'But, it is the same now as it was then: the one born according to flesh persecutes the one born according to Spirit.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004030,'However, what does the Scripture say? “Expel the slave woman and her son, because the son of the slave woman absolutely must not inherit with the son of the free woman!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348004031,'So then, brothers, we are not children of a slave woman, but of the free woman.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005001,'Stand firm therefore in the freedom with which Christ has made us free, and do not be burdened again with a yoke of slavery.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005002,'Listen! I, Paul, say to you that if you get circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005003,'Further, I testify again to every man who gets circumcised that he is obligated to keep the whole law.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005004,'You who are ‘being justified’ by law have been alienated from the Christ; you have fallen away from the grace.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005005,'For we through the Spirit eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005006,'Because in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005007,'You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005008,'This persuasion is not from Him who calls you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005009,'A little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005010,'I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will not think differently; but he who troubles you will bear the penalty, whoever he may be.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005011,'But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that event the offense of the cross would have been removed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005012,'I do wish that those who are upsetting you would just remove themselves!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005013,'Now you, brothers, have been called to freedom; only do not use that freedom as an opening for the flesh, but slave for one another through love.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005014,'For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, namely: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005015,'But if you bite and tear at each other, beware lest you be consumed by one another!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005016,'I say then: walk in the Spirit, and you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005017,'Because the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh; they oppose each other; it follows that you may not do the things that you wish.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005018,'However, if you are led by the Spirit you are not under law.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005019,'Now the works of the flesh are obvious, namely: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, licentiousness,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005020,'idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, fits of anger, selfish ambition, dissentions, factions,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005021,'envyings, murders, drinking bouts, orgies, and the like; about which I am warning you beforehand, as, in fact, I did before, that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005022,'But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005023,'gentleness, self-control—against such things there is no law.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005024,'Further, those who are Christ''s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005025,'Since we live by the Spirit, let us also conform to the Spirit.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348005026,'Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348006001,'Brothers, if a man is actually caught in some wrongdoing, you, the spiritual ones, should restore him in a spirit of gentleness, watching out for yourself lest you also be tempted.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348006002,'Bear one another''s heavy burdens, and so fulfill the law of the Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348006003,'For if anyone thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348006004,'Let each one test his own work, and then do his ‘boasting’ only within himself, never to someone else.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348006005,'For each one must carry his own normal load.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348006010,'So then, as we have opportunity, let us do what is good toward everyone, but especially toward those who are of the household of the faith.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348006012,'Those who want to make a good showing in the flesh are pressuring you to be circumcised, but only so as not to be persecuted for the cross of Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,348006013,'For not even those who are circumcised keep the law themselves, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349003008,'To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349003009,'and to enlighten all as to the program of the secret that from the beginning of the ages has been hidden by the God who created all things through Jesus Christ;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349003010,'to the intent that now, through the Church, the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly realms,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349003011,'according to the eternal purpose that He accomplished by Christ Jesus our Lord,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349003012,'in whom we have the boldness and the access with confidence through faith in Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349003013,'Therefore I ask that you not lose heart at my afflictions on your behalf, which is your glory.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349003014,'For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349003015,'from whom every family in heaven and on earth receives its name,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349003016,'that HeF may grant you, according to the riches of His glory: 1) to be strengthened with power by His Spirit in the inner man;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349003017,'2) Christ to dwell in your hearts through the Faith, having been rooted and established in love'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349003018,'so that you may be fully able to grasp (with all saints) what is the breadth and length and depth and height;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349004007,'Now to each one of us the grace according to the measure of Christ''s gift was given.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349004008,'That is why He says, “When He ascended into the heights He captured the concentration camp, and distributed gifts to men.”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349004011,'Yes, He Himself gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349004014,'so that we no longer be ‘infants’, tossed about as by waves and carried off by every doctrinal fad, through the underhanded dealings of the people who collect the fee for the error;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349004015,'rather, speaking the truth in love, let us in all things grow up into Him who is the Head, the Christ;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349004016,'from whom the whole body, being fitted and knit together by what every joint supplies, as each individual part does its work, promotes its own growth, its own edification, in love.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349004017,'So then, I affirm and insist on this in the Lord: you must no longer carry on as the rest of the Gentiles do, in the futility of their mind,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349004018,'having been darkened in their understanding, being alienated as a continuing condition from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349004019,'who, having become dead to hope, have abandoned themselves to depravity, greedily indulging in every kind of vileness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349004020,'Now that is not how you ‘learned Christ’—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349004021,'if indeed you have heard Him and been taught by Him (as the truth is in Jesus):'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349004022,'that you put away, concerning your former way of life, the old man (that keeps on being corrupted by the deceitful desires),'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349004023,'and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349004031,'Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor and slander be removed from you, with all malice.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349004032,'Rather, be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving one another, just as in Christ God forgave you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349005001,'Therefore be imitators of God as beloved children,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349005004,'nor any obscenity, nor foolish talk or coarse joking (that do not belong), but rather thanksgiving.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349005005,'Because you can know this for sure: no fornicator, nor anyone who is morally corrupt or insatiable (actually an idolater), has any inheritance in the Kingdom of the Christ and God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,349005006,'Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of the disobedience.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,350002008,'And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient to the point of death—even death on a cross!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,350002009,'Indeed, that is why God highly exalted Him and gave Him the name that is above every name,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,351001009,'For this very reason, since the day we heard of it, we have not stopped praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the real knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002002,'Rather, in spite of having already suffered and been insulted in Philippi, as you know, we made bold in our God to speak to you the Gospel of God, in the face of strong opposition.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002003,'Further, our exhortation does not spring from delusion or impurity, nor is it in deception,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002004,'but we speak precisely as those who have been approved by God to be entrusted with the Gospel, not so as to please men, but to please the God who evaluates our hearts.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002005,'Further, you well know that we never used words to flatter, or to disguise greed (God is witness),'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002006,'or to seek glory from men (whether from you or from others)—as apostles of Christ we could have been ‘heavy’,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002007,'but we were gentle among you, like a nurse cherishing her own children.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002008,'Yearning over you in this way, we were well pleased to share with you not only the Gospel of God but also our own selves, because you had become dear to us.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002009,'Surely you remember, brothers, our toil and exertion, because working night and day, so as not to burden any of you, we proclaimed the Gospel of God to you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002010,'You are witnesses, and so is God, how devoutly and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you who believe;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002011,'indeed, you know how we treated each one of you as a father does his own children, exhorting and comforting you,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002012,'insisting that you conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002013,'Another reason we give thanks to God continually is that when you received from us the spoken Word of God, you welcomed it not as the word of men but, as it actually is, the Word of God, which is indeed operative in you who believe.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002014,'For you, brothers, became imitators of God''s congregations in Christ Jesus, the ones in Judea, in that you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen that they did from the Jews'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002015,'(the ones who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, who have persecuted us, who do not please God and are hostile to everybody,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002016,'trying to prevent us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved—so as to fill up the measure of their sins. They have received the full impact of the Wrath).'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002017,'Now we, brothers, having been bereaved of you for a short season (in presence, not in heart), made every effort to see your face, from intense longing.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002018,'(We actually tried to come to you—I, Paul, time and again—but Satan thwarted us.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002019,'For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glorying? Is it not precisely you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352002020,'Indeed, you are our glory and our joy.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003001,'So when we could not stand it any longer, we thought it good to be left in Athens alone'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003002,'and sent Timothy, our brother and minister of God, also our fellow worker in the Gospel of Christ, to confirm you and encourage you concerning your faith,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003003,'that no one be unsettled by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed to this.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003004,'For indeed, when we were with you we kept telling you in advance that we were going to be afflicted; just as it happened, in fact, as you know.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003005,'Yes, that is why, no longer standing it, I sent to find out about your faith, for fear that somehow the tempter had successfully tempted you and our labor come to be for nothing.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003006,'But now that Timothy has come to us from you and brought us glad news of your faith and love, and that you have good memories of us always, longing to see us, just as we also long to see you'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003007,'—because of this, brothers, in all our affliction and distress we were encouraged about you by your faith;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003008,'for now we live, if you are standing firm in the Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003009,'With what thankfulness can we repay God for you, for all the joy with which we are rejoicing in the presence of our God because of you;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003010,'praying most earnestly night and day, that we may see your face and complete the things lacking in your faith?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003011,'Now may our God and Father Himself and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way to you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003012,'And may the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love toward each other and toward all, just as we also do toward you,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352003013,'so as to establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His holy ones.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004001,'Finally then, brothers, we urge and exhort you in the Lord Jesus: as you received from us how you ought to behave and please God, do so even more'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004002,'—you know what instructions we gave you through Sovereign Jesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004003,'Now this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you stay away from fornication;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004004,'that each of you know how to gain possession of his own ‘vessel’ in sanctification and honor,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004005,'not in lustful passion (like the heathen who do not know God);'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004006,'that no one trespass and defraud his brother in this matter, because the Lord is the avenger of all such behavior, as, indeed, we have already told you and warned you.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004007,'Because God did not call us for uncleanness, but by holiness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004008,'So then, the rejecter is not rejecting man, but God, the very One who gave you His Holy Spirit.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004009,'Now about brotherly love you do not need to be written to, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004010,'because in fact you are doing so toward all the brothers throughout Macedonia. Still, we exhort you to do even more, brothers,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004011,'to make it a point to be peaceable and to mind your own business, to work with your hands (as we instructed you),'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004012,'so that outsiders may be well impressed by your life style, and that you may have no lack.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004013,'Now then, brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant about those who have ‘fallen asleep’, so that you do not grieve like the rest, who have no hope.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004014,'Because since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, just so will God bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004015,'For this we say to you by a word of the Lord, that we who are still alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will absolutely not precede those who have fallen asleep;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004016,'because the Lord Himself—with a commanding shout, with the archangel''s voice and with God''s trumpet—will come down from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004017,'then we who are still alive, who are left, will be snatched up together with them in clouds to meet the Lord in the air. In precisely this way we will always be with the Lord.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352004018,'So then, comfort one another with these words.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005001,'Now concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you do not need to be written to,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005002,'for you yourselves know very well that the Day of the Lord comes just like a thief in the night.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005003,'For whenever they say, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction is standing near them, like labor pains to a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005004,'But you, brothers, are not in darkness so that this Day should come upon you like a thief.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005005,'You are all sons of light and sons of day; we are not of night, nor of darkness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005006,'So then, let us not sleep, like the rest, but let us stay alert and sober;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005007,'because those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005008,'but we being of day, let us be sober, putting on a breastplate of faith and love, and a helmet of hope of salvation.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005009,'For God did not appoint us to undergo wrath but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005010,'who died for us so that whether awake or asleep we may live together with Him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005011,'Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, as in fact you do.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005012,'Now we urge you, brothers, to recognize those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005013,'and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005014,'Now we exhort you, brothers: admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, be supportive of the weak, be patient toward all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005015,'See that no one pays back bad for bad to anyone, but always pursue the good, both for one another and for all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005016,'Rejoice always!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005017,'Pray continually!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005018,'Give thanks in everything, for this is God''s will for you in Christ Jesus.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005019,'Do not quench the Spirit!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005020,'Do not disdain prophesies,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005021,'but test everything; hold on to the good.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005022,'Keep away from every form of evil!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005023,'Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005024,'He who calls you is faithful, and He will do it.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005025,'Brothers, pray for us.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005026,'Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005027,'I adjure you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,352005028,'The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353001001,'Paul, Silvanus and Timothy, to the congregation of the Thessalonians in God our Father and Sovereign Jesus Christ:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353001002,'Grace and peace to you from God our Father and Sovereign Jesus Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353001003,'We are obligated to always give thanks to God about you, brothers, and properly so, because your faith is really growing, and the love of each and every one of you towards each other keeps increasing;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353001004,'so that we ourselves boast about you among God''s congregations, referring to your steadfastness and faith in the midst of all your persecutions, and the tribulations that you are enduring'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353001005,'—the above is evidence that God''s judgment is right, to the end that you be considered worthy of the Kingdom of God, on behalf of which you are actually suffering;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353001006,'since to God it is right to pay back affliction to those who are afflicting you'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353001007,'and rest (along with us) to you who are being afflicted, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with His powerful angels in blazing fire,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353001008,'inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353001009,'who will pay a penalty: everlasting ruin, away from the face of the Lord and from the glory of His might,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353001010,'whenever He comes to be glorified by His saints, yes to be marveled at by all who have believed (because our testimony to you was believed); in that Day.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353001011,'To this end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of the calling and fulfill with power every desire of usefulness and work of faith,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353001012,'so that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and Lord, Jesus Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353002001,'Now, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to Him, we urge you'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353002002,'not to be quickly shaken from your conviction or disturbed, whether by a spirit or a word or a letter as from us, as though the Day of Christ has come.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353002003,'Do not let anyone deceive you by any means; because that day cannot come unless the rebellion comes first and the man of sin is revealed, the son of ruin,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353002004,'who opposes and exalts himself over everything that is called a god or an object of worship, to the point of taking his seat as God in God''s sanctuary, proclaiming himself to be God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353002005,'(Don''t you remember that I used to tell you these things while still with you?)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353002006,'So now you know what is restraining, to the end that he may be revealed at his own time.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353002007,'For the mystery of the lawlessness is already at work; only He who now restrains will do so until He removes Himself.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353002008,'And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth and abolish by the splendor of His coming;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353002009,'that one''s coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353002010,'and with all wicked deception among those who are wasting themselves, because they did not receive the love of the truth so that they might be saved.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353002011,'Yes, because of this God will send them an active delusion so that they will believe the lie'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353002012,'and so that all may be condemned who have not believed the truth but have taken pleasure in wickedness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353002013,'Now we are obligated to always give thanks to God about you, brothers loved by the Lord, because from the beginning God chose you into salvation, through sanctification of spirit and belief in truth,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353002014,'to which He called you through our gospel, so as to obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353002015,'So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the traditions that you were taught by us, whether by word or by letter.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353002016,'Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and our God and Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope, by grace,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353003001,'Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified, as also with you,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353003004,'We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you both do and will do the things we command.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353003005,'Now may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the perseverance of Christ.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353003006,'Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who behaves irresponsibly and not according to the tradition that they received from us.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353003007,'For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we did not behave irresponsibly among you;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353003010,'Yes, because when we were with you we gave you this command: “If anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat!”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353003012,'Now to such individuals we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ that they work in quietness and eat their own bread.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353003013,'But as for you, brothers, do not lose heart in well doing.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353003014,'If anyone does not obey our word in this letter, take note of him and do not associate with him, that he may be shamed;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353003016,'Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you the peace during every situation, in every way. The Lord be with you all.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,353003017,'The greeting of Paul, with my own hand, which is the ‘trademark’ in every letter that I write.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,354001003,'You recall that I urged you to remain in Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, in order that you should command certain persons to stop teaching a different doctrine'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,354001005,'Now the goal of that command is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,354001008,'Now we know that the law is good if one uses it correctly,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,354002001,'Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358001005,'For to which of the angels did HeF ever say, “You are my Son, today I begot you,” and again, “I will be ‘Father’ to Him, and He will be ‘Son’ to me?”'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358001014,'Are they not all ministering spirits being sent to serve those who are going to inherit salvation?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002001,'So then, we really must pay the utmost attention to the things we have heard, so that we not drift away.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002002,'For if the word spoken through angels became binding, and every violation and disobedience received a deserved penalty,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002003,'how shall we escape if we are careless about that tremendous salvation?—it received its beginning through the Lord''s declaration and was confirmed to us by those who heard HimS,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002005,'Because it is not to angels that He has subjected the coming inhabited earth, about which we are speaking;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002006,'rather, there is a place where someone testified saying: “What is man that You are mindful of him, or son of man that you care for him?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002007,'You made him lower than the angels, for a little while; You crowned him with glory and honor,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002008,'You subjected all things under his feet.” It follows that in subjecting all things to him, He left nothing that is not so subjected. However, we do not yet see everything subjected to him, at present.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002009,'But we do see Jesus, who ‘was made lower than the angels, for a little while’ (in order to suffer death), ‘crowned with glory and honor’—this, by the grace of God, so that HeS might taste death on behalf of everyone.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002010,'Because it was appropriate to HimF, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons into glory, to complete the Author of their salvation through sufferings.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002011,'For both HeS who is sanctifying and those who are being sanctified are all from One, for which reason He is not ashamed to call them ‘brothers’,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002013,'And again, “I will put my trust in HimF”; and again, “Here am I and the children whom God has given me.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002014,'Since, then, the children have flesh and blood as their share, HeS Himself likewise partook of the same, in order that through His death He might abolish the one who had the power of death—that is, the devil—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002015,'and set free these the children who during their whole lifetime were subject to slavery through fear of death.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002016,'(Now surely He does not assist angels, but He does assist Abraham''s seed.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002017,'That is why He was obliged to become like those ‘brothers’ in all respects, so that He could be a merciful and faithful high priest, in what concerns God, with a view to making propitiation for the sins of the people.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358002018,'For in that in which He Himself endured suffering, having been tested, He is able to assist those who are being tested.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003001,'So then, holy brothers, you who share in the celestial calling, do contemplate the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus Christ!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003002,'who was faithful to the One who appointed Him, as also was Moses in all HisF house.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003003,'For this One has been counted worthy of more glory than was Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003004,'—every house is built by someone, but He who built all things is God—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003005,'also, Moses was indeed faithful as a servant in all His house, providing evidence of those things that would later be spoken,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003006,'but Christ is faithful as a Son over His house, whose house are we, if, that is, we hold fast the confidence, even the boast, of the Hope firm to the end.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003007,'Therefore—just as the Holy Spirit says: “Today, if you would hear His voice,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003008,'do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, during the time of the testing in the desert,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003009,'where your fathers tested me, proved me and saw my works for forty years.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003010,'In consequence I became very angry with that generation and said, ‘Their heart always leads them astray; they have not known my ways.’'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003011,'So I took an oath in my wrath, ‘As if they will ever enter my rest!’ ”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003012,'—take care, brothers, that there not be a malignant heart of unbelief in any of you, so as to go away from the living God;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003013,'rather, exhort yourselves every day, while it is called ‘today’, so that none of you be hardened through sin''s deceitfulness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003014,'For we have become associates of the Christ, if, that is, we hold fast the beginning of the Endeavor firm to the end,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003015,'while it is still being said, “Today, if you would hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003016,'So who were they who, upon hearing, rebelled? Really now, was it not all those who came out of Egypt by Moses?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003017,'And with whom was HeF angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the desert?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003018,'Or to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, if not to those who disobeyed?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358003019,'So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004001,'Therefore we should fear, since a promise of entering His rest still stands, lest any one of you should expect to have come short of it.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004002,'Really, because we are continually hearing Good News just like they did, but the word that they heard did not profit them, since they were not intimately united with the faith of those who obeyed.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004003,'Now we who have believed do enter that rest, just as He has said, “So I took an oath in my wrath, ‘As if they will ever enter my rest!’ ”—His works were certainly finished from the foundation of the world,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004004,'because somewhere He has spoken about the seventh day like this, “And on the seventh day God rested from all His works,”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004005,'while again, in this place, “As if they will ever enter my rest!”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004006,'Therefore since it remains for some to enter into it, and those who formerly had the Good News proclaimed to them did not enter because of disobedience,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004007,'He again designates a certain day, after such a long time, saying through David: “Today” (as was stated above), “Today, if you would hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004008,'Because if Jesus had given them rest, He would not have spoken afterward of another day.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004009,'So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004010,'Further, the one having entered into His rest has himself also rested from his own works, just as God did from His.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004011,'Therefore, let us take pains to enter into that rest so that no one may fall through the same pattern of disobedience.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004012,'Because the Word of God is living and efficient, and sharper than any two-edged sword, actually penetrating to the point of separating soul and spirit, joints and marrow; in fact, it is able to evaluate a heart''s reflections and intentions.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004013,'Nothing in all creation is hidden from His sight; rather all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004014,'Therefore, since we have a Great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the Confession.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004015,'For we do not have a High Priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but He was tested in all points, in similar ways, without sin.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358004016,'So let us approach the throne of grace with confidence, that we may receive mercy and find grace, for timely help.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005001,'Now every high priest taken from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005002,'being able to deal gently with those who sin in ignorance and go astray, since he himself is also subject to weakness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005003,'Because of this he must offer sacrifices for his own sins as well, just as he does for the people''s.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005004,'Also, no one receives this honor on his own, but upon being called by God, just like Aaron.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005005,'So also Christ did not exalt Himself to become High Priest, but it was HeF who said to HimS, “You are my Son; today I have begotten You.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005006,'Just as HeF also says in another place, “You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005007,'HeS, in the days of His flesh, having offered up both prayers and supplications, with a loud cry and tears, to the One who was able to save Him from death, and having been answered because of His godly fear,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005008,'although being SON, He learned obedience by the things which He suffered.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005009,'And having been completed He became the Source of eternal salvation for all those obeying Him,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005010,'having been designated by God as High Priest ‘according to the order of Melchizedek’;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005011,'concerning whom we have much to say, but it is hard to explain, since you have become sluggish in hearing.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005012,'Really, because although by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary principles of God''s oracles all over again; you have come to the point of needing milk, not solid food!'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005013,'Surely; whoever lives on milk is an infant, and therefore unskilled in the Word of righteousness.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358005014,'On the other hand, solid food is for the mature, those who by habitual use have trained their senses to distinguish good from bad.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006001,'Therefore, leaving the elementary teaching about Christ, let us move on toward perfection, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and trust in God,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006002,'of teaching about baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006003,'We will do this, that is, if indeed God should permit it.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006004,'Because, it is impossible to bring back into repentance those who were once for all enlightened, who have partaken of the heavenly gift and were made sharers in the Holy Spirit,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006005,'who have experienced God''s good event and capabilities of the coming age,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006006,'and yet have fallen away—they would be crucifying the Son of God all over again, just for themselves, holding Him up to contempt.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006007,'Now the ground that drinks in the rain that frequently falls on it and produces a crop useful to those for whom it is really cultivated receives blessing from God;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006008,'but should it bear thorns and thistles, it is disqualified, almost a curse, whose destiny is a burning.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006009,'For all that, dear ones, we are confident of the better things concerning you—things that accompany salvation—even though we speak like this.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006010,'Because God is not unjust so as to ignore your work, even the labor of love you have invested in His name, in that you have ministered to the saints and continue to do so.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006011,'You see, we really do want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, so as to fulfill the hope;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006012,'so that you not become lazy, but rather imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006013,'Now when God made a promise to Abraham, since He had no one greater to swear by, He swore by Himself'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006014,'saying, “Indeed, blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006015,'And so, after he had been patient, he obtained the promise.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006016,'Because since men swear by the greater, and for them the confirming oath puts an end to every dispute,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006017,'similarly God, being determined to show even more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchanging nature of His purpose, guaranteed it by an oath,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006018,'so that by two unalterable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we should have a strong encouragement, we who have taken refuge by grasping the hope set before us;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006019,'which hope we have as an anchor for the soul, both certain and secure, actually entering the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358006020,'where Forerunner Jesus has entered on our behalf, having become High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007001,'Now this Melchizedek—king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007002,'to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all (first, his name means ‘king of righteousness’, and then again ‘king of Salem’, which means ‘king of peace’),'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007003,'without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but having been made like the Son of God—remains a priest continually.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007004,'Now consider how great this personage was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils:'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007005,'You see, those of the sons of Levi who receive the priesthood have a command, according to the Law, to collect a tithe from the people—that is, from their brothers—even though they too came out of Abraham''s body;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007006,'but he whose descent is not counted among them collected a tithe from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007007,'Now without dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007008,'Also, here men who die receive tithes, but there he of whom it is testified that he lives'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007009,'—in a word, even Levi, who receives tithes, paid the tithe through Abraham,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007010,'because he was still in the reproductive system of his forefather when Melchizedek met him.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007011,'Now then, if there could be perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people had received the Law), what further need would there be for a different kind of priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, rather than being called according to the order of Aaron?'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007012,'(Because when the priesthood is changed there is also a change of law, of necessity.)'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007013,'For He of whom these things are said belongs to a different tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007014,'For it is evident that our Lord arose out of Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007015,'And it all becomes clearer still if a different kind of priest, in the likeness of Melchizedek, appears,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007016,'who has come, not on the basis of a law about a physical rule but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007017,'Because He testifies: “You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007018,'You see, there is an annulling of the former rule because of its weakness and uselessness'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007019,'(for the Law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007020,'Further, inasmuch as it was not without the taking of an oath'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007021,'—they indeed had become priests without an oath-taking, but HeS with an oath by HimF who said to HimS: “The Lord has sworn and will not change HisF mind; you are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek”'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007022,'—by so much Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007023,'Also, there have been many priests because death prevented them from continuing in office;'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007024,'while HeS, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007025,'Therefore He is able to save absolutely those who come to God through Him, since He always lives and can intercede on their behalf.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007026,'Now such a High Priest was fitting for us—holy, innocent, undefiled, having been set apart from sinners, and having become higher than the heavens—'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007027,'who, unlike those high priests, does not need to offer up daily sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people; because He did this once for all when He offered up Himself.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358007028,'The Law appoints as high priest men who have weakness, but the word of the oath, that came after the Law, appointed Son, forever perfect.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358008001,'Now the main point of the things we are saying is this: We do have such a High Priest, who sat down at the right of the Majesty''s throne in the heavens,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358008002,'Minister of the Holy Places, that is, of the true Tabernacle which the Lord set up, not man.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009011,'But Christ entered once for all into the real Holy Places, having obtained eternal redemption—He had come as High Priest of the good things that are about to be, with the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358009015,'For this reason He is mediator of a new covenant, so that those who have been called may receive the promised eternal inheritance—since a death has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant.'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010003,'However, those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins,'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010004,'because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.'
EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010005,'Therefore, upon coming into the world HeS says: “Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but You prepared a body for me;'

EXEC add_BibleVerse @BibleId,358010011,'Now every priest has stood ministering daily and offering repeatedly the same sacrifices that can never take away sins;'
